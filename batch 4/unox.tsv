But why is hope so important in healthcare, if indeed it is? We examine the answers that are currently on offer and show that none do enough to properly explain the importance that is often attributed to hope in healthcare. We then identify a hitherto unrecognised reason for supposing that it is important to imbue patients undergoing significant medical procedures with hope, which draws on prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky’s hugely influential descriptive theory about decision making in situations of risk and uncertainty. We also consider some concerns about patient consent and the potential manipulation of patients, that are raised by our account. We then consider some complications for the account raised by religious sources of hope, which are commonly drawn on by patients undergoing major healthcare procedures.

In that light, we investigate the rich philosophical contributions of Levinas, Butler, Honneth and Fraser on Vulnerability and Recognition.With these ontological, moral and theological claims, we explore the birth of Conscience as the acknowledgement of guilt, but through a theological anthropology that is constitutively social, looking at matters of collective responsibility and restoration. Jesus' proclamation of the Kingdom of God then becomes the pivot to hear the Call to Discipleship.The three remaining lectures address a connected and collective understanding of humanity in terms of the structures of Grace and Sin, the Virtues and the Beatitudes, and the works of Mercy throughout the World Church."

I show that the relationship is far less clear than is commonly supposed: there is a great heterogeneity in its nature, both among today's workers and workers over time. I explain why the nature of this relationship matters for policymakers concerned about the impact of technology on work. In the short term, it is important for understanding how AI affects not only the quantity of work, but its quality as well: these new technologies may erode the meaning that people get from their work.In the medium term, if jobs are lost, this relationship also matters for designing bold policy interventions like the 'UBI' and 'Job Guarantee Schemes': their design, and any choice between them, is heavily dependent on policymakers' - often tacit - assumptions about the nature of this underlying relationship between work and meaning. For instance, policymakers must decide whether to simply focus on replacing lost income alone (as with a UBI) or, if they believe that work is an important and non-substitutable source of meaning, on protecting jobs for that additional role as well (as with a Job Guarantee Scheme).

The two continent’s key actors have an opportunity to reaffirm what was said by the region’s respective leaders in 2017: that their partnership ought to be built on a “spirit of shared ownership, responsibility, reciprocity, respect and mutual accountability and transparency.”A lot of what has happened recently - from aggravating impacts of climate change, the 2008-2009 financial crisis, to the macroeconomic challenges resulting from a pandemic and the consequences of the War in Ukraine – aggravates the marginalisation of Africa, confirming the need for a change of approach. The colonial shadow, still marking negotiators' mind sets in both sides, is trapping them into the past while overlooking the many opportunities of the future.REGISTRATIONThis talk is live in-person and onlineTo register to attend this talk in-person at the Oxford Martin School, please use the registration form here.To watch this talk live online register on crowdcast here.
