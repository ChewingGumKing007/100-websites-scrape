https://www.soci.org/events/lipids-group/2022/palm-oil-and-our-future-world	Palm oil and our future world	2022-06-15	2022-06-15		Palm oil (and its fractions) is simultaneously one of the world’s most popular and unpopular agricultural crops. Popular, as it is an ingredient in countless food and personal care products, due to its versatility and low cost. It is also used increasingly as a source of biofuel. Unpopular, as the huge growth in the use of palm oil combined with the need for hot and wet growing conditions has resulted in oil palm plantations displacing millions of hectares of tropical rainforest, with an environmental cost in terms of loss of habitats and biodiversity, and release of CO2. Various initiatives have been devised to mitigate this including from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the recent pledges to reduce deforestation at COP26, and the substitution of palm oil by other oils. However, how effective are these initiatives, to what extent is substitution feasible, and how sustainable are the alternatives compared to palm oil?

Curious to learn about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in R&D? AI and ML are promoted as tools that will change the world - in research they promise to deliver powerful new solutions to the discovery and design process. In our future careers in industry and academia, AL and ML will become every-day tools for researchers and having knowledge and understanding of what they could and could not achieve is important for young scientists starting careers in industry. This meeting is for scientists, especially students and young researchers in industry and academia who want to learn more about AI and ML, how this technology might be used and what it could do. The event features talks by experts in academia, industry and from AI/ML companies who apply AI/ML to solve real problems today and in the future. Posters on application of AI and ML welcome."

It has been demonstrated that small, drug-like molecules can be highly effective modulators of immune response pathways and that their molecular properties can be fine-tuned to enable excellent cell permeability and bioavailability. This makes them ideal for use in the treatment of chronic conditions such as autoimmune and inflammation-related diseases. Excitingly, this approach also offers the possibility to treat cancer by harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight tumours.

This meeting will offer a broad introduction to those new to the topic and showcase recent innovations by academic and industrial scientists in this exciting and rapidly expanding field."

With the world becoming increasingly aware of ecological and environmental struggles from pollutants such as microplastics, the materials community has a very real role to play in overcoming the challenges presented by phasing out these materials and replacing them with more environmentally compatible materials. Sustainable materials also have a huge role to play in tacking climate change, with an estimated annual total of 880 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents produced from European manufacturing industries alone – sustainable materials technologies are one of many avenues in which science may present solutions to the threat of climate change.

This workshop offers a unique opportunity to try out a range of software packages for themselves with expert tuition in different aspects of pre-clinical drug discovery. Attendees will be able to choose from sessions covering data processing and visualisation; ligand and structure-based design, or ADMET prediction run by the software providers. All software and training materials required for the workshop will be provided for attendees to install and run on their own laptops and use for a limited period afterwards.

An exciting line-up of leading early career academics will deliver a series of review lectures covering a range of topics, including heterocyclic ring synthesis, protein interactions with small molecules, supramolecular systems, and boron reagents. The meeting will deliver a comprehensive overview of the material, highlight new methods and introduce (potential) industrial applications. The review lectures will be supported by two plenary speakers: Prof Edward Andreson from the University of Oxford and Prof Nicholas Turner from the University of Manchester.
