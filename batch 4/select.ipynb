These clusters of \"assembled cells\" have functional significance and can mimic in vivo organ structure.Liver cells assembled on-board chips in a physiologically-relevant architecture using microfluidics can, for instance, be utilized for toxicity screening and the ability to assemble organ fragments ex vivo can provide an exquisite means to reconstruct biological processes (both physiological and pathological) \"in a dish\" or \"on a chip.\" A number of chips such Lung-on-a-Chip, Brain-on-a-Chip, Gut-on-a-Chip, Marrow-on-a-Chip, Bone-on-a-Chip, Nerve-on-a-Chip amongst others have been built and will be presented and explored at this conference. We will also focus on \"disease-on-a-chip\", cancer-on-a-chip, immune system-on-a-chip.This conference will be held co-located and concurrently with the Lab-on-a-Chip and Microfluidics Europe 2022 Conference.

A multitude of fabrication approaches to generate tissue engineered constructs exist including photopolymerization, 3D-printing, stereolithography, multiphoton lithography as well as self-assembly approaches. While much progress has been made in generating functional tissues using both synthetic and natural materials, increasing throughput and tissue volume has been challenging.This conference focuses on advanced techniques and approaches being used for biofabrication with a focus on potentially scalable technologies that will allow higher throughput manufacturing of functional tissues.In addition to scientific presentations, this conference features exhibits with companies showcasing their technologies and product offerings into this field.This Conference Runs Concurrently and is Co-Located with The Space Summit 2022 and Attendees + Exhibitors Receive Full Access to Both Conferences as part of their Registration-Participation.',\n",
