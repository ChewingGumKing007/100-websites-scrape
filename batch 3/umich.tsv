Nonetheless, many philosophers have argued that norms governing when we should gather evidence or reinquire are at most practical or moral norms. Against this, I argue that norms on inquiring further are central to our conception of responsible epistemic agency. I do this by appealing to both the roles of epistemic evaluations and our practices of holding agents epistemically accountable. My dissertation thereby expands and enriches our understanding of epistemic evaluations and normativity.		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

Collected for each course are objects that address the nature of materiality, time, and human interaction in relation to our environments, our wars, our relationships, and our eccentricities. Working in collaboration with University faculty, the works in this exhibition were selected for their capacity to provoke engagement with the guiding questions and themes of their specific courses, while also offering students inspiration for research and art projects in their areas of study. The exhibition demonstrates some of the diverse and creative ways art plays a central role in learning across the disciplines. It also asks us to consider what we can learn from art objects across an infinite variety of specialties and subject matter. As classes begin in Fall of 2021, you’ll be able to use these pages to explore the collections designed for each course, dive into the works themselves, and hear from the professors and students about how they are engaging with art and objects in new ways. Who knows, maybe you’ll learn something surprising along the way, too.

Unlike any art museum exhibition you’ve seen, FUN (working title) will transform before your very eyes as it becomes what you — our community, our students, and our visitors — make of it. Over the course of this exhibition, UMMA’s glass-walled Stenn gallery will become a creation space. Piles of materials and supplies will form the backdrop of a collaborative, summer-long free artists’ workshop. A place to create, experiment, glue, paint, and get messy. You’re invited to roll up your sleeves and work have fun alongside local artist Mark Tucker and his U-M students to help create this colorful, kinetic, and altogether FUN art installation. Inspired by objects in UMMA’s collection, you’ll create giant movable and interactive sculptures (AKA puppets) that will take on a life of their own. Along the way, you may uncover how art is made, how a museum works, and maybe even discover something about yourself. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the U-M Office of the Provost, the UMMA Docent Program, the U-M Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts, the U-M School of Education, and the University of Michigan Credit Union Arts Adventures Program, UMMA's Lead Sponsor for Student and Family Engagement.

In recent times, growing public awareness of the continued reverberations of the legacy of slavery and colonization has challenged museums to examine the uncomfortable histories contained in our collections, and challenged the public to probe the choices we make about those stories. Choices about which artists you see in our galleries, choices about what relevant facts we share about the works, and choices about what - out of an infinite number of options - we don’t say about them. Pieces in this exhibition were made at a time when the world came to be shaped by the ideologies of colonial expansion and Western domination. And yet, that history and the stories of those marginalized do not readily appear in the still lives and portraits on display here. By grappling with what is visible and what remains hidden, we are forced to examine whose stories and histories are prioritized and why. In this online exhibition, you can explore our efforts to deeply question the Museum’s collection and our own past complicity in favoring colonial voices. In the Museum gallery, which will open in early 2021, you’ll be able to experience the changes we’re making to the physical space to highlight a more honest version of European and American history. By challenging our own practice, and continuing to add to what we know and what we write about the works we display, UMMA tells a more complex and more complete story of this nation - one that unsettles, and fails to settle for, simple narratives. “Invisible things are not necessarily ‘not there’.... Certain absences are so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves; arrest us with intentionality and purpose, like neighborhoods that are defined by the population held away from them.” — Toni Morrison Lead support for Unsettling Histories: Legacies of Slavery and Colonialism is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the U-M Arts Initiative, and the Susan and Richard Gutow Endowed Fund.

Featuring a wide range of artworks—from historic Yoruba and Kongo figures to contemporary works by African and African American artists, such as Sam Nhlengenthwa, Masimba Hwati, Jon Onye Lockard and Shani Peters—the exhibition directly addresses the complex and difficult histories inherent to African art collections in the Global North, including their entanglements with colonization and global efforts to repatriate African artworks to the continent. Art collections, by their very nature, can not be anything other than subjective. With I Write To You About Africa, we examine the subjective ways UMMA and the University of Michigan as a whole have collected and presented art from and connected to the African diaspora. Drawn from art collections across the U-M campus, a special section of the exhibition highlights how the founding of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the African Studies Center (ASC) impacted U–M’s collecting practices. This section includes an exciting and ongoing project—contemporary African artists, scholars, and curators will be asked to write about their work on postcards, in their first language, and mail them to UMMA where they will be displayed alongside their works. We Write To You About Africa will be a reinstallation of the Museum’s Robert and Lillian Montalto Bohlen Gallery of African art and the connected Alfred A Taubman Gallery II. It is slated to open in 2021 and will be on view indefinitely. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs, and the African Studies Center.

The investigation and research into 11 works of African art will be conducted publicly — visitors will have access to documents, photographs, and correspondence that will help us develop a better understanding of each object’s history, grappling in real time with questions surrounding legal and ethical ownership of these artworks. Though complex, this project presents exciting opportunities for museum transparency and creating new pathways for relationship-building with partners in Africa and its diaspora. Museum visitors can begin to explore this investigation online and in-person in Fall 2021. Lead support for the UMMA exhibition Wish You Were Here: African Art and Restitution is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Michigan Arts and Culture Council.

We’ve missed you. On March 16, 2020, we closed our doors, just six days after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. We didn’t know for how long. At that point there were twelve confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washtenaw County. We weren’t wearing masks because we didn’t fully understand how the virus is transmitted. We reopened to the public 488 days later, on June 17, 2021. While it is exciting to be together again and to see the world slowly reopen, we are also deeply impacted by what we’ve been through. This exhibition holds both of those feelings. The works of art in this show were selected because you really need to experience them in person, to be immersed in their textures, patterns, colors, and ideas. The exhibition is designed to remind visitors to be present where they are: to look and feel and be at UMMA, in person at the museum. It also reminds visitors where they aren’t: at home, isolated, connecting with each other virtually. The centerpiece of the exhibition—Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of Keshawn Warren standing in front of a vibrant floral background—exemplifies the idea of being present in oneself. Elsewhere you’ll find experiences for all of your senses. Come visit and play the Harry Bertoia sound sculpture to announce your presence in the gallery. After all, you are here. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch and the University of Michigan Office of the Provost.		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

Map ≠ Territory deconstructs maps that have been used to subjugate, appropriate, and oppress, as well as the maps that counter that power through emancipation and advocacy. The exhibit critically engages with materials that span from the colonial era to modern-day Detroit. The exhibit is available in the Clark Library (second floor Hatcher) during Hatcher Library hours.

The collection — 110 codices (bound manuscripts) and fragments written in Greek from the fourth to the nineteenth centuries C.E. — is the largest such collection in the Western Hemisphere and provides unique insights into this era of achievement in textual transmission, calligraphy, illumination, and bookbinding. The exhibit will be open during Audubon Room hours. A digital version of the exhibit will be available in the Audubon Room and online, and allows visitors to explore other pages of the manuscripts on display and other manuscripts from the collection. This exhibit celebrates two recent publications based on the collection: * Catalogue of Greek Manuscripts at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Vol. 1., by Nadezhda Kavrus-Hoffmann (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2021) * Tradition and Individuality: Bindings from the University of Michigan Greek Manuscript Collection, by Julia Miller (Ann Arbor: The Legacy Press, 2021)		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

Collected for each course are objects that address the nature of materiality, time, and human interaction in relation to our environments, our wars, our relationships, and our eccentricities. Working in collaboration with University faculty, the works in this exhibition were selected for their capacity to provoke engagement with the guiding questions and themes of their specific courses, while also offering students inspiration for research and art projects in their areas of study. The exhibition demonstrates some of the diverse and creative ways art plays a central role in learning across the disciplines. It also asks us to consider what we can learn from art objects across an infinite variety of specialties and subject matter. As classes begin in Fall of 2021, you’ll be able to use these pages to explore the collections designed for each course, dive into the works themselves, and hear from the professors and students about how they are engaging with art and objects in new ways. Who knows, maybe you’ll learn something surprising along the way, too. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, Erica Gervais Pappendick and Ted Pappendick, and the Eleanor Noyes Crumpacker Endowment Fund.

Unlike any art museum exhibition you’ve seen, FUN (working title) will transform before your very eyes as it becomes what you — our community, our students, and our visitors — make of it. Over the course of this exhibition, UMMA’s glass-walled Stenn gallery will become a creation space. Piles of materials and supplies will form the backdrop of a collaborative, summer-long free artists’ workshop. A place to create, experiment, glue, paint, and get messy. You’re invited to roll up your sleeves and work have fun alongside local artist Mark Tucker and his U-M students to help create this colorful, kinetic, and altogether FUN art installation. Inspired by objects in UMMA’s collection, you’ll create giant movable and interactive sculptures (AKA puppets) that will take on a life of their own. Along the way, you may uncover how art is made, how a museum works, and maybe even discover something about yourself. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the U-M Office of the Provost, the UMMA Docent Program, the U-M Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts, the U-M School of Education, and the University of Michigan Credit Union Arts Adventures Program, UMMA's Lead Sponsor for Student and Family Engagement.

https://events.umich.edu/event/94852	Mother Cyborg: Crafting Our Digital Legacy	2022-06-01	2022-06-01	"[{""type"": ""general"", ""Start_time"": ""11:00AM"", ""end_time"": ""5:00PM"", ""timezone"": """", ""days"": ""all""}]"	Detroit-based artist, musician, and educator Mother Cyborg (Diana J. Nucera) debuts a series of quilts that references our relationship to digital technologies, data-mining and security in the age of the Internet. Using bright colors, geometric shapes and patterns, Crafting our Digital Legacy opens up analogue and tactile spaces that invite audiences to reflect upon our collective relationship with internet technologies, identity, legacy, and the future. Mother Cyborg draws from over 15 years experience as a community organizer in Detroit, MI where individuals gained access and agency to (re-)build their neighborhoods, and run their own Internet service providers. In this exhibition, Nucera expands her artist self through fiber works where she addresses critical issues of surveillance, data collection, the redaction of love to likes, and the complexity of identity within it all. Mother Cyborg states, “This work aims to return a sense of wonder and magic to all of us, and rekindle the awe we may have first felt when using a geolocating star map, or being able to video call a person across borders. Crafting our Digital Legacy looks at the way in which art can unpack how living at the whim of invisible wifi connections, engaging ‘power cycling’ (turning on and off) computers and phones to ‘fix’ them, modern experiences of technology run the gamut from resigned faith to proselytizing zealotry. In our weariness of the state of technology, we fail to notice that the ‘same’ data, taken from all of us, has the power to rewrite and mutate the prior century’s worst inequalities into a blueprint for the future. These psychedelic quilts mesmerize while spotlighting surveillance tactics embedded within society bringing into focus the information and questions we should be asking of the future.” Curated by Srimoyee Mitra.

https://events.umich.edu/event/94838	Ruth Weisberg: Of Memory, Time & Place	2022-06-01	2022-06-01	"[{""type"": ""general"", ""Start_time"": ""11:00AM"", ""end_time"": ""5:00PM"", ""timezone"": """", ""days"": ""all""}]"	“One thing that is very clear to me is that my life and my work are very intertwined. For me the creation of my art, be it painting, drawing or printmaking, integrates my life experiences, my beliefs and my heritage. I hope that my viewers will also bring their own lenses created by their identity, their family history and their experiences.” - Ruth Weisberg Ruth Weisberg: Of Memory, Time &amp; Place brings together over 25 works that span six decades of the artist’s practice as a painter and printmaker. It features iconic works from Weisberg’s artistic career - Waterborne (1973), A Year Passes (1985) and Questioning Veronese (2011) - where she explored the interconnectedness and continuity of successive generations. Anchored in themes of personal and familial memory; ancestral knowledge embedded in her Jewish heritage, and admiration for Western art history, her unframed canvases, and works on paper create liminal spaces that collapse the time and space, where family, friends from the present and past share space with great painters and Holocaust survivors and those who perished. The Shtetl, A Journey and Memorial, a limited- edition artist book that she wrote and illustrated comprising 9 intaglio prints in 1971, lies at the heart of the exhibition. In it she paid homage to the small Jewish towns in Poland (where her ancestors are from) before the Holocaust. This significant work was a touchstone for her artistic and professional career as it propelled her move from Michigan to Los Angeles in 1969. Born and raised in Chicago, Weisberg moved to Ann Arbor to pursue her higher studies, she completed her B.Ed (1964), after spending three years in Perugia, Italy where she earned a Laurea di Belle Arti in 1962, and MFA (1965). Since her arrival in Los Angeles, Weisberg has been a formidable influence and mentor to decades of artists as an artist, Professor of Fine Arts and former Dean at the University of Southern California Roski School of Art and Design. Weisberg was the Director of the USC Initiative for Israeli Arts and Humanities, and the founder of the Jewish Artists Initiative of Southern California. Her first major survey in Los Angeles was in 1979 at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. She and Judy Chicago were the first two artists exhibited at The Women’s Building, Los Angeles. Their solo exhibitions inaugurated that venue. Weisberg has had more than 80 solo exhibitions and nearly 200 group exhibitions internationally, including a major exhibition at the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena and a retrospective, at the Skirball Museum, Los Angeles as well as a solo exhibition at the Huntington in San Marino. She is the recipient of many prestigious awards, some notable ones are the Printmaker Emeritus Award from the Southern Graphic Council International in 2015 and the Foundation for Jewish Culture’s 50th Anniversary Cultural Achievement Award in 2011. She has been the recipient of the Art Leadership Award, National Council of Art Administrators and the Women’s Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award, 2009. Ruth Weisberg is represented by Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, Los Angeles. Curated by Srimoyee Mitra.		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

https://events.umich.edu/event/84303	Unsettling Histories: Legacies of Slavery and Colonialism	2022-06-01	2022-06-01	"[{""type"": ""general"", ""Start_time"": ""11:00AM"", ""end_time"": ""5:00PM"", ""timezone"": """", ""days"": ""all""}]"	Organized as a response to the Museum’s recent acquisition of Titus Kaphar’s Flay (James Madison), this upcoming reinstallation of one of our most prominent gallery spaces forces us to grapple with our collection of European and American art, 1650-1850. In recent times, growing public awareness of the continued reverberations of the legacy of slavery and colonization has challenged museums to examine the uncomfortable histories contained in our collections, and challenged the public to probe the choices we make about those stories. Choices about which artists you see in our galleries, choices about what relevant facts we share about the works, and choices about what - out of an infinite number of options - we don’t say about them. Pieces in this exhibition were made at a time when the world came to be shaped by the ideologies of colonial expansion and Western domination. And yet, that history and the stories of those marginalized do not readily appear in the still lives and portraits on display here. By grappling with what is visible and what remains hidden, we are forced to examine whose stories and histories are prioritized and why. In this online exhibition, you can explore our efforts to deeply question the Museum’s collection and our own past complicity in favoring colonial voices. In the Museum gallery, which will open in early 2021, you’ll be able to experience the changes we’re making to the physical space to highlight a more honest version of European and American history. By challenging our own practice, and continuing to add to what we know and what we write about the works we display, UMMA tells a more complex and more complete story of this nation - one that unsettles, and fails to settle for, simple narratives. “Invisible things are not necessarily ‘not there’.... Certain absences are so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves; arrest us with intentionality and purpose, like neighborhoods that are defined by the population held away from them.” — Toni Morrison Lead support for Unsettling Histories: Legacies of Slavery and Colonialism is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the U-M Arts Initiative, and the Susan and Richard Gutow Endowed Fund.

Featuring a wide range of artworks—from historic Yoruba and Kongo figures to contemporary works by African and African American artists, such as Sam Nhlengenthwa, Masimba Hwati, Jon Onye Lockard and Shani Peters—the exhibition directly addresses the complex and difficult histories inherent to African art collections in the Global North, including their entanglements with colonization and global efforts to repatriate African artworks to the continent. Art collections, by their very nature, can not be anything other than subjective. With I Write To You About Africa, we examine the subjective ways UMMA and the University of Michigan as a whole have collected and presented art from and connected to the African diaspora. Drawn from art collections across the U-M campus, a special section of the exhibition highlights how the founding of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the African Studies Center (ASC) impacted U–M’s collecting practices. This section includes an exciting and ongoing project—contemporary African artists, scholars, and curators will be asked to write about their work on postcards, in their first language, and mail them to UMMA where they will be displayed alongside their works. We Write To You About Africa will be a reinstallation of the Museum’s Robert and Lillian Montalto Bohlen Gallery of African art and the connected Alfred A Taubman Gallery II. It is slated to open in 2021 and will be on view indefinitely. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs, and the African Studies Center.

The investigation and research into 11 works of African art will be conducted publicly — visitors will have access to documents, photographs, and correspondence that will help us develop a better understanding of each object’s history, grappling in real time with questions surrounding legal and ethical ownership of these artworks. Though complex, this project presents exciting opportunities for museum transparency and creating new pathways for relationship-building with partners in Africa and its diaspora. Museum visitors can begin to explore this investigation online and in-person in Fall 2021.

We’ve missed you. On March 16, 2020, we closed our doors, just six days after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. We didn’t know for how long. At that point there were twelve confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washtenaw County. We weren’t wearing masks because we didn’t fully understand how the virus is transmitted. We reopened to the public 488 days later, on June 17, 2021. While it is exciting to be together again and to see the world slowly reopen, we are also deeply impacted by what we’ve been through. This exhibition holds both of those feelings. The works of art in this show were selected because you really need to experience them in person, to be immersed in their textures, patterns, colors, and ideas. The exhibition is designed to remind visitors to be present where they are: to look and feel and be at UMMA, in person at the museum. It also reminds visitors where they aren’t: at home, isolated, connecting with each other virtually. The centerpiece of the exhibition—Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of Keshawn Warren standing in front of a vibrant floral background—exemplifies the idea of being present in oneself. Elsewhere you’ll find experiences for all of your senses. Come visit and play the Harry Bertoia sound sculpture to announce your presence in the gallery. After all, you are here.

This work is motivated by the Argo data, a dataset of measurements of the upper 2,000 meters of the world's oceans, which has revolutionized the scientific community's monitoring of oceanic temperature and salinity in the past 20 years. This data has a number of complex and challenging features for statistical analysis. It is inherently a 4-dimensional space-time dataset: one observes data in space (longitude and latitude), time, and pressure (or equivalently, depth) in the ocean. Data collection occurs at more than 100,000 locations per year and consists of hundreds of millions of measurements. Measured ocean variables display nonstationarity as their statistical properties significantly change over time and over space. The contribution of this thesis is the development of statistical methodology for this data with a focus on spatio-temporal functional data. That is, we treat the Argo data as functions of pressure that describe ocean characteristics in the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, and we extend perspectives used in spatial statistics to functional data with the goal of addressing the complex features of the data. In the first chapter, we introduce the Argo data and relevant literature in more detail. In the next chapter, we describe a local estimation approach for spatio-temporal functional data, using the Argo dataset as an instrumental framework for this approach. In the third chapter, we consider the theoretical statistical performance of such estimation methodology in a spatial functional-data setting. In the fourth chapter, we develop statistical methodology for clustering multivariate spatio-temporal functional data in a functional regression framework to predict dissolved oxygen concentration in the ocean. In the fifth chapter, we introduce a new Matérn model for multivariate time series and random fields that offers improved model flexibility over previously proposed models. Finally, we discuss open questions that have arisen from our work.		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar! Use this site to browse and search for events happening throughout campus.

A digital version of the exhibit will be available in the Audubon Room and online, and allows visitors to explore other pages of the manuscripts on display and other manuscripts from the collection. This exhibit celebrates two recent publications based on the collection: * Catalogue of Greek Manuscripts at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Vol. 1., by Nadezhda Kavrus-Hoffmann (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2021) * Tradition and Individuality: Bindings from the University of Michigan Greek Manuscript Collection, by Julia Miller (Ann Arbor: The Legacy Press, 2021)		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

Collected for each course are objects that address the nature of materiality, time, and human interaction in relation to our environments, our wars, our relationships, and our eccentricities. Working in collaboration with University faculty, the works in this exhibition were selected for their capacity to provoke engagement with the guiding questions and themes of their specific courses, while also offering students inspiration for research and art projects in their areas of study. The exhibition demonstrates some of the diverse and creative ways art plays a central role in learning across the disciplines. It also asks us to consider what we can learn from art objects across an infinite variety of specialties and subject matter. As classes begin in Fall of 2021, you’ll be able to use these pages to explore the collections designed for each course, dive into the works themselves, and hear from the professors and students about how they are engaging with art and objects in new ways. Who knows, maybe you’ll learn something surprising along the way, too. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, Erica Gervais Pappendick and Ted Pappendick, and the Eleanor Noyes Crumpacker Endowment Fund.

Unlike any art museum exhibition you’ve seen, FUN (working title) will transform before your very eyes as it becomes what you — our community, our students, and our visitors — make of it. Over the course of this exhibition, UMMA’s glass-walled Stenn gallery will become a creation space. Piles of materials and supplies will form the backdrop of a collaborative, summer-long free artists’ workshop. A place to create, experiment, glue, paint, and get messy. You’re invited to roll up your sleeves and work have fun alongside local artist Mark Tucker and his U-M students to help create this colorful, kinetic, and altogether FUN art installation. Inspired by objects in UMMA’s collection, you’ll create giant movable and interactive sculptures (AKA puppets) that will take on a life of their own. Along the way, you may uncover how art is made, how a museum works, and maybe even discover something about yourself. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the U-M Office of the Provost, the UMMA Docent Program, the U-M Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts, the U-M School of Education, and the University of Michigan Credit Union Arts Adventures Program, UMMA's Lead Sponsor for Student and Family Engagement.

In recent times, growing public awareness of the continued reverberations of the legacy of slavery and colonization has challenged museums to examine the uncomfortable histories contained in our collections, and challenged the public to probe the choices we make about those stories. Choices about which artists you see in our galleries, choices about what relevant facts we share about the works, and choices about what - out of an infinite number of options - we don’t say about them. Pieces in this exhibition were made at a time when the world came to be shaped by the ideologies of colonial expansion and Western domination. And yet, that history and the stories of those marginalized do not readily appear in the still lives and portraits on display here. By grappling with what is visible and what remains hidden, we are forced to examine whose stories and histories are prioritized and why. In this online exhibition, you can explore our efforts to deeply question the Museum’s collection and our own past complicity in favoring colonial voices. In the Museum gallery, which will open in early 2021, you’ll be able to experience the changes we’re making to the physical space to highlight a more honest version of European and American history. By challenging our own practice, and continuing to add to what we know and what we write about the works we display, UMMA tells a more complex and more complete story of this nation - one that unsettles, and fails to settle for, simple narratives. “Invisible things are not necessarily ‘not there’.... Certain absences are so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves; arrest us with intentionality and purpose, like neighborhoods that are defined by the population held away from them.” — Toni Morrison Lead support for Unsettling Histories: Legacies of Slavery and Colonialism is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the U-M Arts Initiative, and the Susan and Richard Gutow Endowed Fund.

Featuring a wide range of artworks—from historic Yoruba and Kongo figures to contemporary works by African and African American artists, such as Sam Nhlengenthwa, Masimba Hwati, Jon Onye Lockard and Shani Peters—the exhibition directly addresses the complex and difficult histories inherent to African art collections in the Global North, including their entanglements with colonization and global efforts to repatriate African artworks to the continent. Art collections, by their very nature, can not be anything other than subjective. With I Write To You About Africa, we examine the subjective ways UMMA and the University of Michigan as a whole have collected and presented art from and connected to the African diaspora. Drawn from art collections across the U-M campus, a special section of the exhibition highlights how the founding of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the African Studies Center (ASC) impacted U–M’s collecting practices. This section includes an exciting and ongoing project—contemporary African artists, scholars, and curators will be asked to write about their work on postcards, in their first language, and mail them to UMMA where they will be displayed alongside their works. We Write To You About Africa will be a reinstallation of the Museum’s Robert and Lillian Montalto Bohlen Gallery of African art and the connected Alfred A Taubman Gallery II. It is slated to open in 2021 and will be on view indefinitely. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs, and the African Studies Center.

The investigation and research into 11 works of African art will be conducted publicly — visitors will have access to documents, photographs, and correspondence that will help us develop a better understanding of each object’s history, grappling in real time with questions surrounding legal and ethical ownership of these artworks. Though complex, this project presents exciting opportunities for museum transparency and creating new pathways for relationship-building with partners in Africa and its diaspora. Museum visitors can begin to explore this investigation online and in-person in Fall 2021. Lead support for the UMMA exhibition Wish You Were Here: African Art and Restitution is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Michigan Arts and Culture Council.

We’ve missed you. On March 16, 2020, we closed our doors, just six days after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. We didn’t know for how long. At that point there were twelve confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washtenaw County. We weren’t wearing masks because we didn’t fully understand how the virus is transmitted. We reopened to the public 488 days later, on June 17, 2021. While it is exciting to be together again and to see the world slowly reopen, we are also deeply impacted by what we’ve been through. This exhibition holds both of those feelings. The works of art in this show were selected because you really need to experience them in person, to be immersed in their textures, patterns, colors, and ideas. The exhibition is designed to remind visitors to be present where they are: to look and feel and be at UMMA, in person at the museum. It also reminds visitors where they aren’t: at home, isolated, connecting with each other virtually. The centerpiece of the exhibition—Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of Keshawn Warren standing in front of a vibrant floral background—exemplifies the idea of being present in oneself. Elsewhere you’ll find experiences for all of your senses. Come visit and play the Harry Bertoia sound sculpture to announce your presence in the gallery. After all, you are here. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch and the University of Michigan Office of the Provost.		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

Nucera) debuts a series of quilts that references our relationship to digital technologies, data-mining and security in the age of the Internet. Using bright colors, geometric shapes and patterns, Crafting our Digital Legacy opens up analogue and tactile spaces that invite audiences to reflect upon our collective relationship with internet technologies, identity, legacy, and the future. Mother Cyborg draws from over 15 years experience as a community organizer in Detroit, MI where individuals gained access and agency to (re-)build their neighborhoods, and run their own Internet service providers. In this exhibition, Nucera expands her artist self through fiber works where she addresses critical issues of surveillance, data collection, the redaction of love to likes, and the complexity of identity within it all. Mother Cyborg states, “This work aims to return a sense of wonder and magic to all of us, and rekindle the awe we may have first felt when using a geolocating star map, or being able to video call a person across borders. Crafting our Digital Legacy looks at the way in which art can unpack how living at the whim of invisible wifi connections, engaging ‘power cycling’ (turning on and off) computers and phones to ‘fix’ them, modern experiences of technology run the gamut from resigned faith to proselytizing zealotry. In our weariness of the state of technology, we fail to notice that the ‘same’ data, taken from all of us, has the power to rewrite and mutate the prior century’s worst inequalities into a blueprint for the future. These psychedelic quilts mesmerize while spotlighting surveillance tactics embedded within society bringing into focus the information and questions we should be asking of the future.” Curated by Srimoyee Mitra.

For me the creation of my art, be it painting, drawing or printmaking, integrates my life experiences, my beliefs and my heritage. I hope that my viewers will also bring their own lenses created by their identity, their family history and their experiences.” - Ruth Weisberg Ruth Weisberg: Of Memory, Time &amp; Place brings together over 25 works that span six decades of the artist’s practice as a painter and printmaker. It features iconic works from Weisberg’s artistic career - Waterborne (1973), A Year Passes (1985) and Questioning Veronese (2011) - where she explored the interconnectedness and continuity of successive generations. Anchored in themes of personal and familial memory; ancestral knowledge embedded in her Jewish heritage, and admiration for Western art history, her unframed canvases, and works on paper create liminal spaces that collapse the time and space, where family, friends from the present and past share space with great painters and Holocaust survivors and those who perished. The Shtetl, A Journey and Memorial, a limited- edition artist book that she wrote and illustrated comprising 9 intaglio prints in 1971, lies at the heart of the exhibition. In it she paid homage to the small Jewish towns in Poland (where her ancestors are from) before the Holocaust. This significant work was a touchstone for her artistic and professional career as it propelled her move from Michigan to Los Angeles in 1969. Born and raised in Chicago, Weisberg moved to Ann Arbor to pursue her higher studies, she completed her B.Ed (1964), after spending three years in Perugia, Italy where she earned a Laurea di Belle Arti in 1962, and MFA (1965). Since her arrival in Los Angeles, Weisberg has been a formidable influence and mentor to decades of artists as an artist, Professor of Fine Arts and former Dean at the University of Southern California Roski School of Art and Design. Weisberg was the Director of the USC Initiative for Israeli Arts and Humanities, and the founder of the Jewish Artists Initiative of Southern California. Her first major survey in Los Angeles was in 1979 at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. She and Judy Chicago were the first two artists exhibited at The Women’s Building, Los Angeles. Their solo exhibitions inaugurated that venue. Weisberg has had more than 80 solo exhibitions and nearly 200 group exhibitions internationally, including a major exhibition at the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena and a retrospective, at the Skirball Museum, Los Angeles as well as a solo exhibition at the Huntington in San Marino. She is the recipient of many prestigious awards, some notable ones are the Printmaker Emeritus Award from the Southern Graphic Council International in 2015 and the Foundation for Jewish Culture’s 50th Anniversary Cultural Achievement Award in 2011. She has been the recipient of the Art Leadership Award, National Council of Art Administrators and the Women’s Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award, 2009. Ruth Weisberg is represented by Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, Los Angeles. Curated by Srimoyee Mitra.		Welcome to the University of Michigan Events Calendar!

Through a variety of interactive activities and case studies, participants will be able to explore from a distance the way bias plays out in mentoring relationships, dive into closer practice to recognize their own bias from a mentor’s perspective, and develop strategies to interrupt various biases to ensure particular kinds of collaborations with members of their (future) teams. Participants will also be able to tap into personal knowledge and experiences as mentors or mentees and create the vision and practice of mentorship they would like to pursue in their particular fields and careers. The session’s main objective is to recognize the power of intentional mentorship within the inclusive leadership framework by enhancing participants’ skills and professional toolkits and their understanding of differences, thus, ultimately, achieving a higher level of comfort with both vulnerability and life long growth when advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion.

My research uses several approaches for investigating the multiple sources of variation that can impact observed phenotypic traits. I highlight how functional traits impacting dispersal ability in Caribbean mangrove species, when coupled with spatially explicit ocean current data, can lead to crucial insights about how genetic variation was shaped by the environment. Especially in periods of rapid climate change, environmental pressures can impact the adaptive nature of traits, and in some cases, adaptive variation can transcend species boundaries. Using a case of recent (i.e., Pleistocene) hybridization in montane sedges, I illustrate how genotype-environment association analyses identify adaptive loci with respect to environmental gradients that overwhelmingly correspond to loci with excess ancestry from one parental lineage. Digitized museum specimens may represent an efficient way to study the interaction of genome, phenome, and environment; I propose an analytical framework for explicitly quantifying the covariation of genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data from thousands of conspecific specimens.

This potent combination, paired with a robust tour calendar, have made the veteran band hands-down favorites of fans and peers alike. From their base in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains, The Steel Wheels have played the most prestigious festivals, listening rooms, and clubs in the world, earning a reputation as one of the top independent bands on the scene today. While 2017s’ stunning studio album, Wild As We Came Here, was still ringing in the air, the band shone a light on their concerts with the release of two EPs of live music; Volume 1: Live at the Station Inn, and Volume 2: Live at The Jefferson Theatre. Ever ambitious and not content to let moss grow under their feet, the Wheels returned to the studio-retreat of Sam Kassirer, producer of Wild, to record another studio album that will be released summer 2019. In keeping with their relentless growth, the quartet, has become a quintet with the permanent addition of percussionist Kevin Garcia to the longtime lineup of Brian Dickel, Trent Wagler, Jay Lapp, and Eric Brubaker. --- Proof of COVID vaccination required for entry.
