https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/dm22	SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics (DM22)	2022-06-14	2022-06-16		This is the conference of the SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics.Discrete mathematics is a branch of the mathematical sciences, with a wide range of challenging research problems and important applications in industry. Discrete mathematics has applications to all fields of computer science, and to the physical and biological sciences. It is used extensively in telecommunications, information processing, and manufacturing, and many businesses and industries use techniques of discrete optimization to improve the efficiency of their operations.Discrete mathematics is a dynamic field in both theory and applications. Researchers in discrete mathematics have established important connections with mainstream areas of pure and applied mathematics, and as a consequence, research techniques and problems are drawn from a wide range of different fields, including algebra, topology, geometry, probability, analysis and logic.The purpose of this conference is to highlight the major theoretical advances in the field, the development of new tools for discrete mathematics, and the most significant of the new applications of discrete mathematics to problems arising in industry and business. The conference also seeks to bring together participants from the many different environments where discrete mathematics is developed and applied.

https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/cse23	SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE23)	2023-02-26	2023-02-03		"This is the meeting of the SIAM Activity Group on Computational Science and Engineering. Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) complement theory and experiment as a critical component of scientific discovery. CSE is indispensable for leading edge investigation and engineering design in a vast number of industrial sectors, including for example, aerospace, automotive, biological, chemical, and semiconductor technologies that all rely increasingly on advanced modeling and simulation. CSE also contributes to policy and decisions relating to human health, resources, transportation, and defense. Finally, in many new areas such as medicine, the life sciences, management and marketing (e.g., data and stream mining), and finance, techniques and algorithms from CSE are of growing importance.CSE is naturally interdisciplinary. Its goals concern understanding and analyzing complex systems, predicting their behavior, and optimizing processes and designs. CSE thus grows out of physical applications, while depending on computer architecture and software, and having at its core powerful algorithms. At the frontiers of CSE remain many open problems and challenges, including the verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of computational models; the analysis and assimilation of large and complex data sets, including techniques for visualization and animation; and the design of flexible CSE software. The SIAM CSE conference seeks to enable in-depth technical discussions on a wide variety of major computational efforts on large-scale problems in science and engineering, foster the interdisciplinary culture required to meet these large-scale challenges, and promote the training of the next generation of computational scientists.Statement on Potentially Offensive Material There is no general rule on what material is appropriate for presentation at SIAM conferences. However, we urge participants to be aware that the use of some material (text, images, etc.) may offend attendees of SIAM conferences, and to refrain from using this material in their presentations. For example, the ""Lena image,"" which is a segment of centerfold that appeared in a 1972 “adult” magazine, has in the past been used in publications on imaging, and is inconsistent with efforts to promote women in science and engineering. SIAM will not consider journal submissions containing images such as this, and we request that all SIAM conference participants also refrain from using similar material in any presentations."
