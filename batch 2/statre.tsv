Information is knowledge and knowledge is power. With an ever-changing climate of technology and threats (both technical and human), the need for trained security personnel to protect our information becomes increasingly critical evolutionary task. Information is at risk from many sources, legal, electronic, physical, internal and external to mention a few. It is paramount that security and related management personnel have an understanding of the risks, controls and countermeasures that are available to secure information and technology within an effective management framework. Furthermore, utilizing countermeasures, best practice and management techniques will mitigate electronic and physical risks and enhance protection to an organization.

Limited availability of additional land for crop production along with declining yield growth for major food crops have heightened concerns about agriculture’s ability to feed the world population. Much currently cultivated land is being lost through soil erosion, nutrient depletion, desertification, deforestation, and salinization or overgrazing. As agricultural areas become even more crowded, arable land is likely to come under increasing pressure. Integrated soil health and fertility management (ISHFM) is the key in raising productivity levels while maintaining the natural resource base.

Limited availability of additional land for crop production along with declining yield growth for major food crops have heightened concerns about agriculture’s ability to feed the world population. Much currently cultivated land is being lost through soil erosion, nutrient depletion, desertification, deforestation, and salinization or overgrazing. As agricultural areas become even more crowded, arable land is likely to come under increasing pressure.

In case of emergency closures, action is often taken based on panic. Very often these actions aggravate the situation, instead of resolving it.
