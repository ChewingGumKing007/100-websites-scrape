       "  'The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) released its annual statistics for the False Claims Act (FCA) and fraud cases for fiscal year 2021. The DOJ reported that it recovered $5.6 billion in final judgments and settlements during this time period — the second largest annual total in FCA history, and the largest since 2014. With 598 qui tam lawsuits filed in 2021, and 203 filed by DOJ, the recovery statistics for fiscal year 2021 show a sustained and aggressive use of the FCA by the government and qui tam relators alike. The DOJ also announced that the Civil Division will “energetically use every enforcement tool available to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting the COVID-19 crisis.” In addition, DOJ appointed a Chief Prosecutor to lead pandemic recovery fraud efforts. Finally, DOJ revealed the creation of a Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative that will utilize the FCA to pursue cybersecurity related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients. By all accounts, the trend for government initiated FCA actions is continuing to climb, leaving the industry wondering: What will total recoveries amount to at the end of Fiscal ’22? What can we expect for Fiscal ‘22? Where will government enforcement priorities lie? Which industries are at greatest risk? What can you do now to prepare for the next wave of FCA enforcement and protect your client’s interests? ACI’s 9th Advanced Forum on False Claims and Qui Tam Enforcement, taking place IN-PERSON in New York City, will address the underlying controversies and challenges posed by these questions. Join us for in-depth discussions and analyses of the latest guidance, initiatives, and enforcement statistics, featuring a faculty of government speakers and leading defense, in-house, and relators’ counsel.',\n",

Biosimilars and innovator biologics are among the most groundbreaking therapies that treat many life-threatening conditions. However, even with a calendar year that included 4 FDA approvals, 3 launches in the United Sates, 2 approvals for interchangeable biosimilars, and several regulatory and legal developments, the traditional barriers continue to be complicated, interconnected, and best addressed by stakeholder collaboration. We’ve reached an inflection point in the United States. With another major wave of loss of exclusivities of original biological medicines expected in the next five to ten years, it is imperative that industry is well prepared today. Now, more than ever, strategies to overcome these barriers are essential to improve the understanding of biosimilar products in the United States. The need for a solid guiding framework becomes more critical than ever before. In this context, we cordially invite you to explore the contours of the rapidly changing landscape for biosimilars and innovator biologics. This June, join the “who’s who” of the biosimilars and innovator biologics industries as they gather in Boston for ACI’s 13th Annual Summit on Biosimilars & Innovator Biologics.',\n",
