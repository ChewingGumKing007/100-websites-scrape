Explore the trends in digitization that help us communicate, connect, and collaborate in new and exciting ways, and how you can use accessible tools for onboarding, training, and teambuilding. We’ll also review core concepts needed such as data governance and compliance obligations; identify opportunities for process efficiencies and improving basic gift processing; learn how to set, prioritize, and achieve data hygiene goals; and discuss standard and nonstandard gift processes.
