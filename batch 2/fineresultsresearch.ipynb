Little attention is given to characteristics often associated with survey data, including missing data, unequal probabilities of selection, stratified multistage sample designs, and measurement errors. Most standard statistical procedures in software packages commonly used for data analysis do not allow the analyst to take these properties of survey data into account unless specialized survey procedures are used. Failure to do so can have an important impact on the results of all types of analyses, ranging from simple descriptive statistics to estimates of parameters of multivariate models. This course provides an introduction to specialized software procedures that have been developed for the analysis of complex sample survey data including testing for between-group differences in means and proportions, regression analysis, logistic regression and multilevel modeling. We will also consider the consequences of non response and missing data on survey analysis and methods for dealing with missing data.

The Africa’s dairy industry is however faced with a number of challenges, including low productivity per cow, fluctuating milk production, inconsistent milk quality, the high cost of production, inefficiencies along the value chain and a large informal sector dominance in milk sale. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers are characterized by low milk output and low milk quality leading to low income from sale of milk. With the anticipated increase in demand of dairy products following population growth, urbanisation and improved purchasing power, there is need for dairy farmers to embrace interventions that may lead to increased milk productivity and enhanced milk quality.

Dairying is however faced with various challenges including feed shortage and low quality of feeds that limit dairy production, high costs of concentrates which are also of poor quality, high costs of feeds and inadequate advice on dairy cattle feeding and feed formulations for the farms and limited knowledge on best feeding practices among other challenges. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers end up making losses or stagnant in their production which is contrary to their goal of making profit. Understanding how to formulate feeds can go a long way in improving feeding of dairy animals and in reducing feeds costs. In addition, a good livestock diet can boost profitability on the farms, as well-fed animals are healthier, more productive.',\n",

Fish contribute up to 17 % of animal protein, and 7 % of all proteins, and supports more than 3 billion people in developing countries. Fish provides high-quality essential amino acids, docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, especially iron, zinc, and vitamins, often in highly bioavailable forms. Fish farming therefore can contribute in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) on eliminating all forms of hunger, as well as food and nutritional insecurity. To add on, due to high demand and price of fish in the market and the shrinking job market, rapid population growth, decreasing sources of employment, commercial fish farming can be a great source of employment for unemployed people. This 5- days course aims to equip participants with skills and knowledge on fish production including feeding, harvesting, and the basics of running a successful fish farming business.',\n",

In project planning, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, there is need to identify key indicators that will help in measuring the impact of the project on all targeted individuals and genders. To do this, appropriate tools are necessary, particularly with respect to measuring gender equality and social inclusion. This 5 days course will equip participants with knowledge on the appropriate tools that can be used to measure the extent of social inclusion and impact of project on gender dimensions.',\n",

Although there has been a strong interest from policymakers, investors and also re-structuring of dairy value chains, dairy sector potential is still underexploited partly because of a number of production, marketing and trade constraints that hinder its development. Farmers therefore receives low prices when production is high and high prices when production is low. This negative price fluctuations is particularly because of their dependence in weather for their dairy production. Value addition can help stabilise prices, increase Kenya’s exports and promote rural sustainable development. This five (5) days course aim to offer knowledge on value addition of raw milk by producing a wide variety of processed products, to increase the return above the base price of raw milk.',\n",

       "  'Scientific research may not be completely objective if it is not gender sensitive. This is because gender norms affect who does the research, how research is prioritized, how the research is designed and conducted, and how data is interpreted and shared as well as the impact of the research at the community level and globally. Also, many countries have adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that besides having a gender equality goal every other goal has a gender dimension in it. To establish the implementation of these goals, development research is led by science. Therefore, if science is gender biased then the research will not produce the right results. For research to ensure equal benefits between men and women, it is imperative to integrate gender dimensions into your research right from the proposal planning stage and throughout the entire cycle of research. This means being gender sensitive beginning from proposal development, implementation all the way to realizing the impact of research. Similarly, gender norms and gender inequality within the cultural context where scaling is taking place influence uptake of technologies. Therefore, failing to take into account gender differences in needs, preferences, roles and responsibilities, decision-making, access to and control of resources that includes (land, labor, inputs, credits and revenue), and power imbalances can limit the adoption of technologies and also lead to research providing recommendations that are not gender inclusive. Consequently, the research can result in the development of policies, legal frameworks and laws that are gender biased thereby perpetuate gender inequality. Integrating gender into scientific research will improve the quality and relevance of research, and lead to new ideas and ways of thinking about issues, and new interpretations of data. This will contribute to innovation, and will improve the outcomes of the research for both women and men, and for entire society at large.',\n",

       "  'GeoServer is a Java-based software server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. Using open standards set forth by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing. GeoServer allows you to display your spatial information to the world. Implementing theWeb Map Service (WMS) standard, GeoServer can create maps in a variety of output formats.OpenLayers, a free mapping library, is integrated into GeoServer, making map generation quick and easy. GeoServer is built on Geotools,an open source Java GIS toolkit. There is much more to GeoServer than nicely styled maps, though. GeoServer also conforms to the Web Feature Service(WFS) standard, which permits the actual sharing and editing of the data that is used to generate the maps. Others can incorporate your data into their websites and applications, freeing your data and permitting greater transparency. GeoServer is free software. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional GIS products. In addition, not only is it available free of charge, it is also open source. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to traditional software solutions. Leveraging GeoServer in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costly support contracts down the road. GeoServer can display data on any of the popular mapping applications such asGoogle Maps, Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and Microsoft Virtual Earth. In addition, GeoServer can connect with traditional GIS architectures such asESRI ArcGIS. This will help participants on how to administrate and publish GIS data with GeoServer, build their custom maps using your own data without the need for costly commercial software. The participants will learn how to load, publish, and share geospatial data with GeoServer. Including navigating the GeoServer user interface, OGC web services, styling data with SLD, connect to backend data such as PostGIS and tile caching with GeoWebCache.',\n",

It’s a known fact that information is processed from facts and figures; we also agree that if data is not well managed it can be overwhelming. Giving a spatial dimension to data and performing spatial analysis in a GIS environment speeds interpretation visualization which eventually speeds up implementation of programs. To make timely decisions requires not only innovative ways to access accurate and real time information, but also tools to help present the information in ways that are useful .Integrating GIS and Remote Sensing as a decision making tool has seen many organizations gain competitive advantage and remain relevant globally. Everything that happens in this world has a spatial dimension and this has made GIS applicable across all fields e.g. in health, agriculture, forestry, mining, crime, business, transport and communications, utility management, climate change, planning etc. A geographic information system (GIS) will allow you to bring all types of data inform of layers, overlay them to perform analysis and eventually publish a map from that. This training workshop is aimed at helping our client understand how well they can apply GIS and RS in their day to day running of their organization. The course will be offered in a mixture of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on exercises in Quantum GIS (QGIS).',\n",

Public health focuses on the health of populations rather than of individuals and focuses more on prevention of health problems. These efforts fall naturally within the domain of problems requiring use of spatial analysis as part of the solution, and GIS and other spatial analysis tools are therefore recognized as providing potentially transformational capabilities for Epidemiology and public health efforts. Statistics are a mainstay in the toolkit of public health professionals. Human memory being what it is, however, even Public health professionals with reasonable statistical training, over the years, often forget the basics. If professionals are going to make sensible use of consultants, communicate effectively with funders, and understand others’ reports, then they often need at least a conceptual understanding of relatively complex, recently developed statistical techniques. This course are: to link common public health questions with appropriate statistical procedures; to offer a strong conceptual grounding in several important statistical procedures; and to describe how to interpret the results from the statistics in ways that are principled and will be persuasive to intended audiences using simple software tools. Participants will acquire hands-on skills in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool to capture, store, analyze, manage, and visualize disease cases data that is geographically linked.

Specifically, Goal 1 and 2 on ending poverty in all forms everywhere and ending hunger respectively are related in that, in most cases poverty is the main reason for hunger at the household level or at the national level. Many countries have put effort in the agriculture sector to improve production. While increased agricultural production is essential in improving food security status of household and the nation, it is not sufficient to reduce hunger and poverty. There is therefore a need for promoting the entire agricultural value chain through collaborative efforts among the state and the non-state actors such as donors, banks, civil society organizations, private sector, religious groups, and agricultural associations among other groups. These collaborations can be informed by studying the entire chain, identifying opportunities and constraints and assessing the need for Business Development Services (BDSs) that includes input, advisory services, market information/communication, business management, legal services, financial services, transport services, insurance, farm implements (tools and equipment) and value addition that can help smallholder farmers improve enterprise(s) performance. This 5 day course intends to equip participants with knowledge on use of strategies that involve provision of financial and non- financial products such as market information through ICT, advisory/technical support for capacity building, gathering and storage, value addition which contribute to the improved value chains among others all intended to enhance agribusiness role in food security.',\n",

       "  'In Africa, close to 70% of the population rely on agriculture as a source of their livelihoods. The sector contributes up to 23% to the GDP in most of the African countries and hence remains critical to local and regional economies. It is the basis for food security and an important source of employment, particularly for women who provide much of labor. Despite the women contribution to the sector, their participation is limited by factors including inequitable access to agricultural inputs, including family labour, high-yield crops, pesticides, and fertilizer, legal and cultural status, exclusion from alternative employment options and inheritance laws. In the spirit of achieving the aspiration of vision 2030 of leaving no one behind and particularly women, there is need to understand through gender analysis the extent to which women are included in the agricultural sector. Gender analysis provides information to integrate a gender perspective into policies, programmes and projects. To add on, conducting a gender analysis allows for the development of interventions that address gender inequalities and meet the different needs of women and men. This 5 days course will equip participants with knowledge about specific set of frameworks and methods for participants to use in order to integrate gender components into their agricultural projects and programs. Participants will also gain gender analysis skills through effective and systematic analysis of contexts and also be able to plan development from a gender equality perspective.',\n",

More than 60 % of sub Saharan Africa’s population is smallholder farmers and up to 23 % of GDP in this region comes from agriculture. In Africa, about 40 % of the population which is equivalent to 80 million people live with disabilities. Despite the contribution of agriculture to nation’s gross domestic product, employment creation, food security among others, the majority of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lives in rural areas and they are prone to severe poverty and deprivation. The social exclusion of people living with disability has led to lack of empowerment efforts for people with disability through Agriculture based interventions since many of them experience social and economic exclusion due to their disability. In the spirit of adoption of vision 2030 agenda, which is in accordance with UN member states pledge to ensure “no one will be left behind” and to “endeavor to reach the furthest behind first”, there is need to enhance gender equality and social inclusion in agriculture a sector that supports a majority of rural population. What's more, gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) can promote equitable development.\",\n",

In order to build the capacity of Development professionals who are actively engaged in the Development and Emergency response activities in governmental and non-governmental organizations, this one week course will provide hands-on training in DRR and the application of Knowledge to decision making in DRR planning and Management. The workshop offers intensive training that will cover the fundamental concepts and tools for DRR. People-centered early warning systems empower communities to prepare for and confront the power of natural hazards and measurement of the systems in terms of lives saved and reduction in losses, which is directly related to the execution of an anticipated response by the people and institutions once a warning is issued. This training will also address traditional views on early warning systems, and what it takes to transform them into efficient, people-centred systems. The workshop also presents a practical guide for using a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate, visualize, and analyze geographically-referenced data extracted from key data sets to facilitate DRR.',\n",

The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a brand to its environment. Although the relevant environment is very broad, encompassing social as well as economic forces, the key aspect of the brand’s environment is the industry or industries in which it competes. Therefore, the goal of competitive strategy for a brand is to find a position in the industry where the brand can: 1) articulate a compelling value proposition, 2) defend itself against competitive forces and influence them in its favor and 3) leverage communication resources to sell the brand message and build brand equity. In this course, participants will examine how a favorable brand and memorable brand experiences can influence a firm’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and thrive in dynamic market conditions. They will study brand management from the consumer perspective to highlight the importance of customer perceptions in bringing brands to life and the role of brand knowledge in building brand equity. Participants will become acquainted with cutting-edge frameworks, concepts and tools that have been adopted across industries and around the globe to build lucrative brand franchises. Additionally, participants will consider the role of marketing communication vehicles and platforms in effective brand management. ',\n",

Developing a contingency plan involves making decisions in advance about the management of human and financial resources, coordination and communications procedures, and being aware of a range of technical and logistical responses. Such planning is a management tool, involving all sectors, which can help ensure timely and effective provision of humanitarian aid to those most in need when a disaster occurs. Time spent in contingency planning equals time saved when a disaster occurs. Effective contingency planning should lead to timely and effective disaster-relief operations. The contingency planning process can basically be broken down into three simple questions: What is going to happen? What are we going to do about it? What can we do ahead of time to get prepared? This training helps planners think through these questions in a systematic way. Contingency planning is most often undertaken when there is a specific threat or hazard; exactly how that threat will actually impact is unknown. Developing scenarios is a good way of thinking through the possible impacts. On the basis of sensible scenarios it is possible to develop a plan that sets out the scale of the responseandthe resources needed.',\n",

Viewing the Earth from space is now crucial to the understanding of the influence of man’s activities on his natural resource base over time. In situations of rapid and often unrecorded land use change, observations of the earth from space provide objective information of human utilization of the landscape. Over the past years, data from Earth sensing satellites has become vital in mapping the Earth’s features and infrastructures, managing natural resources and studying environmental change.

For farmers, data such as weather data, market price data, and agricultural inputs data can improve farmer productivity by addressing key constraints, providing knowledge and access to appropriate inputs, extension advice, weather warnings and market prices. Data on quantity of produce, seasonal variation in production and varieties of crops grown can inform other actors in other sectors such as manufacturing in planning on expected quantity of produce supply. It is therefore important to collect accurate and timely data from agriculture sector which will inform decision making in interlinked sectors.

Little attention is given to characteristics often associated with survey data, including missing data, unequal probabilities of selection, stratified multistage sample designs, and measurement errors. Most standard statistical procedures in software packages commonly used for data analysis do not allow the analyst to take these properties of survey data into account unless specialized survey procedures are used. Failure to do so can have an important impact on the results of all types of analyses, ranging from simple descriptive statistics to estimates of parameters of multivariate models. This course provides an introduction to specialized software procedures that have been developed for the analysis of complex sample survey data including testing for between-group differences in means and proportions, regression analysis, logistic regression and multilevel modeling. We will also consider the consequences of non response and missing data on survey analysis and methods for dealing with missing data. Specialized procedures for survey data analysis from the Stata systems for data management and analysis will be used to develop course examples and exercises',\n",

These rural farmers therefore lack the capacity to make their farming business as efficient as possible and hence suffer economically. Organizations and institutions including microfinance have come to solve farmers’ problems but still farmers experience the challenges because they have no voice in these organizations as well as in the interventions that are designed to solve their problems. To access finances, most microfinance institutions use farm records as collateral and individual farmers in a stable farmer group as granters.

       "  'GeoServer is a Java-based software server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. Using open standards set forth by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing. GeoServer allows you to display your spatial information to the world. Implementing theWeb Map Service (WMS) standard, GeoServer can create maps in a variety of output formats.OpenLayers, a free mapping library, is integrated into GeoServer, making map generation quick and easy. GeoServer is built on Geotools,an open source Java GIS toolkit. There is much more to GeoServer than nicely styled maps, though. GeoServer also conforms to the Web Feature Service(WFS) standard, which permits the actual sharing and editing of the data that is used to generate the maps. Others can incorporate your data into their websites and applications, freeing your data and permitting greater transparency. GeoServer is free software. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional GIS products. In addition, not only is it available free of charge, it is also open source. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to traditional software solutions. Leveraging GeoServer in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costly support contracts down the road. GeoServer can display data on any of the popular mapping applications such asGoogle Maps, Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and Microsoft Virtual Earth. In addition, GeoServer can connect with traditional GIS architectures such asESRI ArcGIS. This will help participants on how to administrate and publish GIS data with GeoServer, build their custom maps using your own data without the need for costly commercial software. The participants will learn how to load, publish, and share geospatial data with GeoServer. Including navigating the GeoServer user interface, OGC web services, styling data with SLD, connect to backend data such as PostGIS and tile caching with GeoWebCache.',\n",

It’s a known fact that information is processed from facts and figures; we also agree that if data is not well managed it can be overwhelming. Giving a spatial dimension to data and performing spatial analysis in a GIS environment speeds interpretation visualization which eventually speeds up implementation of programs. To make timely decisions requires not only innovative ways to access accurate and real time information, but also tools to help present the information in ways that are useful .Integrating GIS and Remote Sensing as a decision making tool has seen many organizations gain competitive advantage and remain relevant globally. Everything that happens in this world has a spatial dimension and this has made GIS applicable across all fields e.g. in health, agriculture, forestry, mining, crime, business, transport and communications, utility management, climate change, planning etc. A geographic information system (GIS) will allow you to bring all types of data inform of layers, overlay them to perform analysis and eventually publish a map from that.

       "  'In Africa, the dairy sector is crucial for rural development, poverty reduction and food and nutrition security. The sector is mainly dominated by smallholder dairy farmers. The Africa’s dairy industry is however faced with a number of challenges, including low productivity per cow, fluctuating milk production, inconsistent milk quality, the high cost of production, inefficiencies along the value chain and a large informal sector dominance in milk sale. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers are characterized by low milk output and low milk quality leading to low income from sale of milk. With the anticipated increase in demand of dairy products following population growth, urbanisation and improved purchasing power, there is need for dairy farmers to embrace interventions that may lead to increased milk productivity and enhanced milk quality. This 5-days course will equip participants with hands on skills on feed types, quality and quantity, feed storage and preservation, housing of a dairy cow, dairy cow management and record keeping among others.

For example, discrete choice modeling is used in agriculture to inform on the best technology or innovation that are beneficial to farmers. In terms of health, discrete choice modeling informs on the preference of health and healthcare. In market research, discrete choice modeling can guide product positioning, pricing, product concept testing.

Pastoralism plays an important role in the national and regional economies of Africa in terms of export of animals to both domestic and international markets. Furthermore, pastoralism contributes a percentage of 10 to 44 of the gross domestic product (GDP) of African countries. Despite the significant impact of pastoralism to livelihoods, economy of Africa’s drylands, GDP and exports sector, pastoralists are faced with various challenges including climate change and climate variability, increasing risk of animal and zoonotic diseases, insecure land rights and natural resource management, violence, displacement and militarisation of pastoral livelihood systems and neglect and exclusion of pastoralist communities among other challenges. One of the key intervention to ensure sustainable livelihoods of pastoralist is focus on building resilience to mitigate effects of climate change. Resilience is being understood in terms of building different types of capacity within communities and social-ecological systems. Building resilience of vulnerable communities to the vagaries of climate change calls for more transformative approaches that can organically evolve to suit the dynamic and unique needs of different farming systems. This 5- days course aim to equip participants with knowledge of empowering pastoralist in building resilience to mitigate effects of climate change. ',\n",

Public health focuses on the health of populations rather than of individuals and focuses more on prevention of health problems. These efforts fall naturally within the domain of problems requiring use of spatial analysis as part of the solution, and GIS and other spatial analysis tools are therefore recognized as providing potentially transformational capabilities for Epidemiology and public health efforts. Statistics are a mainstay in the toolkit of public health professionals. Human memory being what it is, however, even Public health professionals with reasonable statistical training, over the years, often forget the basics. If professionals are going to make sensible use of consultants, communicate effectively with funders, and understand others’ reports, then they often need at least a conceptual understanding of relatively complex, recently developed statistical techniques. This course are: to link common public health questions with appropriate statistical procedures; to offer a strong conceptual grounding in several important statistical procedures; and to describe how to interpret the results from the statistics in ways that are principled and will be persuasive to intended audiences using simple software tools. Participants will acquire hands-on skills in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool to capture, store, analyze, manage, and visualize disease cases data that is geographically linked.

Specifically, Goal 1 and 2 on ending poverty in all forms everywhere and ending hunger respectively are related in that, in most cases poverty is the main reason for hunger at the household level or at the national level. Many countries have put effort in the agriculture sector to improve production. While increased agricultural production is essential in improving food security status of household and the nation, it is not sufficient to reduce hunger and poverty. There is therefore a need for promoting the entire agricultural value chain through collaborative efforts among the state and the non-state actors such as donors, banks, civil society organizations, private sector, religious groups, and agricultural associations among other groups. These collaborations can be informed by studying the entire chain, identifying opportunities and constraints and assessing the need for Business Development Services (BDSs) that includes input, advisory services, market information/communication, business management, legal services, financial services, transport services, insurance, farm implements (tools and equipment) and value addition that can help smallholder farmers improve enterprise(s) performance. This 5 day course intends to equip participants with knowledge on use of strategies that involve provision of financial and non- financial products such as market information through ICT, advisory/technical support for capacity building, gathering and storage, value addition which contribute to the improved value chains among others all intended to enhance agribusiness role in food security.',\n",

Fish contribute up to 17 % of animal protein, and 7 % of all proteins, and supports more than 3 billion people in developing countries. Fish provides high-quality essential amino acids, docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, especially iron, zinc, and vitamins, often in highly bioavailable forms. Fish farming therefore can contribute in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) on eliminating all forms of hunger, as well as food and nutritional insecurity. To add on, due to high demand and price of fish in the market and the shrinking job market, rapid population growth, decreasing sources of employment, commercial fish farming can be a great source of employment for unemployed people. This 5- days course aims to equip participants with skills and knowledge on fish production including feeding, harvesting, and the basics of running a successful fish farming business.',\n",

The sector contributes up to 23% to the GDP in most of the African countries and hence remains critical to local and regional economies. It is the basis for food security and an important source of employment, particularly for women who provide much of labor. Despite the women contribution to the sector, their participation is limited by factors including inequitable access to agricultural inputs, including family labour, high-yield crops, pesticides, and fertilizer, legal and cultural status, exclusion from alternative employment options and inheritance laws. In the spirit of achieving the aspiration of vision 2030 of leaving no one behind and particularly women, there is need to understand through gender analysis the extent to which women are included in the agricultural sector. Gender analysis provides information to integrate a gender perspective into policies, programmes and projects. To add on, conducting a gender analysis allows for the development of interventions that address gender inequalities and meet the different needs of women and men. This 5 days course will equip participants with knowledge about specific set of frameworks and methods for participants to use in order to integrate gender components into their agricultural projects and programs. Participants will also gain gender analysis skills through effective and systematic analysis of contexts and also be able to plan development from a gender equality perspective.',\n",

More than 60 % of sub Saharan Africa’s population is smallholder farmers and up to 23 % of GDP in this region comes from agriculture. In Africa, about 40 % of the population which is equivalent to 80 million people live with disabilities. Despite the contribution of agriculture to nation’s gross domestic product, employment creation, food security among others, the majority of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lives in rural areas and they are prone to severe poverty and deprivation. The social exclusion of people living with disability has led to lack of empowerment efforts for people with disability through Agriculture based interventions since many of them experience social and economic exclusion due to their disability. In the spirit of adoption of vision 2030 agenda, which is in accordance with UN member states pledge to ensure “no one will be left behind” and to “endeavor to reach the furthest behind first”, there is need to enhance gender equality and social inclusion in agriculture a sector that supports a majority of rural population.

       "  'Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) skills are fundamental to the process of increasing awareness on natural hazards and disaster risk reduction to key stakeholders with knowledge on disaster management to empower the actors to support their organizations in developing disaster resilient programs and projects. In order to build the capacity of Development professionals who are actively engaged in the Development and Emergency response activities in governmental and non-governmental organizations, this one week course will provide hands-on training in DRR and the application of Knowledge to decision making in DRR planning and Management. The workshop offers intensive training that will cover the fundamental concepts and tools for DRR. People-centered early warning systems empower communities to prepare for and confront the power of natural hazards and measurement of the systems in terms of lives saved and reduction in losses, which is directly related to the execution of an anticipated response by the people and institutions once a warning is issued. This training will also address traditional views on early warning systems, and what it takes to transform them into efficient, people-centred systems. The workshop also presents a practical guide for using a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate, visualize, and analyze geographically-referenced data extracted from key data sets to facilitate DRR.',\n",

The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a brand to its environment. Although the relevant environment is very broad, encompassing social as well as economic forces, the key aspect of the brand’s environment is the industry or industries in which it competes. Therefore, the goal of competitive strategy for a brand is to find a position in the industry where the brand can: 1) articulate a compelling value proposition, 2) defend itself against competitive forces and influence them in its favor and 3) leverage communication resources to sell the brand message and build brand equity. In this course, participants will examine how a favorable brand and memorable brand experiences can influence a firm’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and thrive in dynamic market conditions. They will study brand management from the consumer perspective to highlight the importance of customer perceptions in bringing brands to life and the role of brand knowledge in building brand equity. Participants will become acquainted with cutting-edge frameworks, concepts and tools that have been adopted across industries and around the globe to build lucrative brand franchises. Additionally, participants will consider the role of marketing communication vehicles and platforms in effective brand management. ',\n",

As a result, the agriculture data can go along way beyond the data requirements of the immediate agriculture sector. For farmers, data such as weather data, market price data, and agricultural inputs data can improve farmer productivity by addressing key constraints, providing knowledge and access to appropriate inputs, extension advice, weather warnings and market prices. Data on quantity of produce, seasonal variation in production and varieties of crops grown can inform other actors in other sectors such as manufacturing in planning on expected quantity of produce supply. It is therefore important to collect accurate and timely data from agriculture sector which will inform decision making in interlinked sectors.

Viewing the Earth from space is now crucial to the understanding of the influence of man’s activities on his natural resource base over time. In situations of rapid and often unrecorded land use change, observations of the earth from space provide objective information of human utilization of the landscape. Over the past years, data from Earth sensing satellites has become vital in mapping the Earth’s features and infrastructures, managing natural resources and studying environmental change.

Developing a contingency plan involves making decisions in advance about the management of human and financial resources, coordination and communications procedures, and being aware of a range of technical and logistical responses. Such planning is a management tool, involving all sectors, which can help ensure timely and effective provision of humanitarian aid to those most in need when a disaster occurs. Time spent in contingency planning equals time saved when a disaster occurs. Effective contingency planning should lead to timely and effective disaster-relief operations. The contingency planning process can basically be broken down into three simple questions: What is going to happen? What are we going to do about it? What can we do ahead of time to get prepared? This training helps planners think through these questions in a systematic way. Contingency planning is most often undertaken when there is a specific threat or hazard; exactly how that threat will actually impact is unknown. Developing scenarios is a good way of thinking through the possible impacts. On the basis of sensible scenarios it is possible to develop a plan that sets out the scale of the responseandthe resources needed.',\n",

Pastoralism plays an important role in the national and regional economies of Africa in terms of export of animals to both domestic and international markets. Furthermore, pastoralism contributes a percentage of 10 to 44 of the gross domestic product (GDP) of African countries. Despite the significant impact of pastoralism to livelihoods, economy of Africa’s drylands, GDP and exports sector, pastoralists are faced with various challenges including climate change and climate variability, increasing risk of animal and zoonotic diseases, insecure land rights and natural resource management, violence, displacement and militarisation of pastoral livelihood systems and neglect and exclusion of pastoralist communities among other challenges. One of the key intervention to ensure sustainable livelihoods of pastoralist is focus on building resilience to mitigate effects of climate change. Resilience is being understood in terms of building different types of capacity within communities and social-ecological systems. Building resilience of vulnerable communities to the vagaries of climate change calls for more transformative approaches that can organically evolve to suit the dynamic and unique needs of different farming systems. This 5- days course aim to equip participants with knowledge of empowering pastoralist in building resilience to mitigate effects of climate change. ',\n",

The Africa’s dairy industry is however faced with a number of challenges, including low productivity per cow, fluctuating milk production, inconsistent milk quality, the high cost of production, inefficiencies along the value chain and a large informal sector dominance in milk sale. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers are characterized by low milk output and low milk quality leading to low income from sale of milk. With the anticipated increase in demand of dairy products following population growth, urbanisation and improved purchasing power, there is need for dairy farmers to embrace interventions that may lead to increased milk productivity and enhanced milk quality. This 5-days course will equip participants with hands on skills on feed types, quality and quantity, feed storage and preservation, housing of a dairy cow, dairy cow management and record keeping among others.

       "  'In Africa, the dairy sector is crucial for rural development, poverty reduction and food and nutrition security. The sector is mainly dominated by smallholder dairy farmers. The Africa’s dairy industry is however faced with a number of challenges, including low productivity per cow, fluctuating milk production, inconsistent milk quality, the high cost of production, inefficiencies along the value chain and a large informal sector dominance in milk sale. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers are characterized by low milk output and low milk quality leading to low income from sale of milk. With the anticipated increase in demand of dairy products following population growth, urbanisation and improved purchasing power, there is need for dairy farmers to embrace interventions that may lead to increased milk productivity and enhanced milk quality. This 5-days course will equip participants with hands on skills on feed types, quality and quantity, feed storage and preservation, housing of a dairy cow, dairy cow management and record keeping among others.

Farmers therefore receives low prices when production is high and high prices when production is low. This negative price fluctuations is particularly because of their dependence in weather for their dairy production.

Dairying is however faced with various challenges including feed shortage and low quality of feeds that limit dairy production, high costs of concentrates which are also of poor quality, high costs of feeds and inadequate advice on dairy cattle feeding and feed formulations for the farms and limited knowledge on best feeding practices among other challenges. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers end up making losses or stagnant in their production which is contrary to their goal of making profit.

Little attention is given to characteristics often associated with survey data, including missing data, unequal probabilities of selection, stratified multistage sample designs, and measurement errors. Most standard statistical procedures in software packages commonly used for data analysis do not allow the analyst to take these properties of survey data into account unless specialized survey procedures are used. Failure to do so can have an important impact on the results of all types of analyses, ranging from simple descriptive statistics to estimates of parameters of multivariate models. This course provides an introduction to specialized software procedures that have been developed for the analysis of complex sample survey data including testing for between-group differences in means and proportions, regression analysis, logistic regression and multilevel modeling. We will also consider the consequences of non response and missing data on survey analysis and methods for dealing with missing data. Specialized procedures for survey data analysis from the Stata systems for data management and analysis will be used to develop course examples and exercises',\n",

Hence, discrete choice models analyses individual choice behavior and solves problems in many fields such as agriculture, economics, accounting, health, engineering, environmental management, urban planning, tourism and transportation among other fields. For example, discrete choice modeling is used in agriculture to inform on the best technology or innovation that are beneficial to farmers. In terms of health, discrete choice modeling informs on the preference of health and healthcare. In market research, discrete choice modeling can guide product positioning, pricing, product concept testing. This 5 days course will equip participants with skills on how to use databases to estimate and test discrete choice models as well as gain hands-on experience in using discrete choice techniques for practical applications.

This is because gender norms affect who does the research, how research is prioritized, how the research is designed and conducted, and how data is interpreted and shared as well as the impact of the research at the community level and globally. Also, many countries have adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that besides having a gender equality goal every other goal has a gender dimension in it. To establish the implementation of these goals, development research is led by science. Therefore, if science is gender biased then the research will not produce the right results. For research to ensure equal benefits between men and women, it is imperative to integrate gender dimensions into your research right from the proposal planning stage and throughout the entire cycle of research. This means being gender sensitive beginning from proposal development, implementation all the way to realizing the impact of research. Similarly, gender norms and gender inequality within the cultural context where scaling is taking place influence uptake of technologies. Therefore, failing to take into account gender differences in needs, preferences, roles and responsibilities, decision-making, access to and control of resources that includes (land, labor, inputs, credits and revenue), and power imbalances can limit the adoption of technologies and also lead to research providing recommendations that are not gender inclusive. Consequently, the research can result in the development of policies, legal frameworks and laws that are gender biased thereby perpetuate gender inequality. Integrating gender into scientific research will improve the quality and relevance of research, and lead to new ideas and ways of thinking about issues, and new interpretations of data. This will contribute to innovation, and will improve the outcomes of the research for both women and men, and for entire society at large.',\n",

Using open standards set forth by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing. GeoServer allows you to display your spatial information to the world. Implementing theWeb Map Service (WMS) standard, GeoServer can create maps in a variety of output formats.OpenLayers, a free mapping library, is integrated into GeoServer, making map generation quick and easy. GeoServer is built on Geotools,an open source Java GIS toolkit. There is much more to GeoServer than nicely styled maps, though. GeoServer also conforms to the Web Feature Service(WFS) standard, which permits the actual sharing and editing of the data that is used to generate the maps. Others can incorporate your data into their websites and applications, freeing your data and permitting greater transparency. GeoServer is free software. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional GIS products. In addition, not only is it available free of charge, it is also open source. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to traditional software solutions. Leveraging GeoServer in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costly support contracts down the road. GeoServer can display data on any of the popular mapping applications such asGoogle Maps, Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and Microsoft Virtual Earth. In addition, GeoServer can connect with traditional GIS architectures such asESRI ArcGIS. This will help participants on how to administrate and publish GIS data with GeoServer, build their custom maps using your own data without the need for costly commercial software. The participants will learn how to load, publish, and share geospatial data with GeoServer. Including navigating the GeoServer user interface, OGC web services, styling data with SLD, connect to backend data such as PostGIS and tile caching with GeoWebCache.',\n",

Public health focuses on the health of populations rather than of individuals and focuses more on prevention of health problems. These efforts fall naturally within the domain of problems requiring use of spatial analysis as part of the solution, and GIS and other spatial analysis tools are therefore recognized as providing potentially transformational capabilities for Epidemiology and public health efforts. Statistics are a mainstay in the toolkit of public health professionals. Human memory being what it is, however, even Public health professionals with reasonable statistical training, over the years, often forget the basics. If professionals are going to make sensible use of consultants, communicate effectively with funders, and understand others’ reports, then they often need at least a conceptual understanding of relatively complex, recently developed statistical techniques. This course are: to link common public health questions with appropriate statistical procedures; to offer a strong conceptual grounding in several important statistical procedures; and to describe how to interpret the results from the statistics in ways that are principled and will be persuasive to intended audiences using simple software tools. Participants will acquire hands-on skills in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool to capture, store, analyze, manage, and visualize disease cases data that is geographically linked. The participants will also acquire statistical data analysis skills.',\n",

It’s a known fact that information is processed from facts and figures; we also agree that if data is not well managed it can be overwhelming. Giving a spatial dimension to data and performing spatial analysis in a GIS environment speeds interpretation visualization which eventually speeds up implementation of programs. To make timely decisions requires not only innovative ways to access accurate and real time information, but also tools to help present the information in ways that are useful .Integrating GIS and Remote Sensing as a decision making tool has seen many organizations gain competitive advantage and remain relevant globally. Everything that happens in this world has a spatial dimension and this has made GIS applicable across all fields e.g. in health, agriculture, forestry, mining, crime, business, transport and communications, utility management, climate change, planning etc. A geographic information system (GIS) will allow you to bring all types of data inform of layers, overlay them to perform analysis and eventually publish a map from that. This training workshop is aimed at helping our client understand how well they can apply GIS and RS in their day to day running of their organization. The course will be offered in a mixture of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on exercises in Quantum GIS (QGIS).',\n",

       "  'At the Global level, the world is implementing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals—to address urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. Specifically, Goal 1 and 2 on ending poverty in all forms everywhere and ending hunger respectively are related in that, in most cases poverty is the main reason for hunger at the household level or at the national level. Many countries have put effort in the agriculture sector to improve production. While increased agricultural production is essential in improving food security status of household and the nation, it is not sufficient to reduce hunger and poverty. There is therefore a need for promoting the entire agricultural value chain through collaborative efforts among the state and the non-state actors such as donors, banks, civil society organizations, private sector, religious groups, and agricultural associations among other groups. These collaborations can be informed by studying the entire chain, identifying opportunities and constraints and assessing the need for Business Development Services (BDSs) that includes input, advisory services, market information/communication, business management, legal services, financial services, transport services, insurance, farm implements (tools and equipment) and value addition that can help smallholder farmers improve enterprise(s) performance. This 5 day course intends to equip participants with knowledge on use of strategies that involve provision of financial and non- financial products such as market information through ICT, advisory/technical support for capacity building, gathering and storage, value addition which contribute to the improved value chains among others all intended to enhance agribusiness role in food security.',\n",

Fish provides high-quality essential amino acids, docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, especially iron, zinc, and vitamins, often in highly bioavailable forms. Fish farming therefore can contribute in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) on eliminating all forms of hunger, as well as food and nutritional insecurity. To add on, due to high demand and price of fish in the market and the shrinking job market, rapid population growth, decreasing sources of employment, commercial fish farming can be a great source of employment for unemployed people.

The sector contributes up to 23% to the GDP in most of the African countries and hence remains critical to local and regional economies. It is the basis for food security and an important source of employment, particularly for women who provide much of labor. Despite the women contribution to the sector, their participation is limited by factors including inequitable access to agricultural inputs, including family labour, high-yield crops, pesticides, and fertilizer, legal and cultural status, exclusion from alternative employment options and inheritance laws. In the spirit of achieving the aspiration of vision 2030 of leaving no one behind and particularly women, there is need to understand through gender analysis the extent to which women are included in the agricultural sector. Gender analysis provides information to integrate a gender perspective into policies, programmes and projects. To add on, conducting a gender analysis allows for the development of interventions that address gender inequalities and meet the different needs of women and men. This 5 days course will equip participants with knowledge about specific set of frameworks and methods for participants to use in order to integrate gender components into their agricultural projects and programs. Participants will also gain gender analysis skills through effective and systematic analysis of contexts and also be able to plan development from a gender equality perspective.',\n",

These rural farmers therefore lack the capacity to make their farming business as efficient as possible and hence suffer economically. Organizations and institutions including microfinance have come to solve farmers’ problems but still farmers experience the challenges because they have no voice in these organizations as well as in the interventions that are designed to solve their problems. To access finances, most microfinance institutions use farm records as collateral and individual farmers in a stable farmer group as granters. This 5 days course sought to empower participants with knowledge on process of accessing rural finance. ',\n",

More than 60 % of sub Saharan Africa’s population is smallholder farmers and up to 23 % of GDP in this region comes from agriculture.

Despite the contribution of agriculture to nation’s gross domestic product, employment creation, food security among others, the majority of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lives in rural areas and they are prone to severe poverty and deprivation. The social exclusion of people living with disability has led to lack of empowerment efforts for people with disability through Agriculture based interventions since many of them experience social and economic exclusion due to their disability. In the spirit of adoption of vision 2030 agenda, which is in accordance with UN member states pledge to ensure “no one will be left behind” and to “endeavor to reach the furthest behind first”, there is need to enhance gender equality and social inclusion in agriculture a sector that supports a majority of rural population.

The advancement in the concept of vegetation mapping has greatly increased research on land use land cover change thus providing an accurate evaluation of the spread and health of the world’s forest, grassland, and agricultural resources has become an important priority. Viewing the Earth from space is now crucial to the understanding of the influence of man’s activities on his natural resource base over time. In situations of rapid and often unrecorded land use change, observations of the earth from space provide objective information of human utilization of the landscape. Over the past years, data from Earth sensing satellites has become vital in mapping the Earth’s features and infrastructures, managing natural resources and studying environmental change. Participants will therefore acquire hands-on skills in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing as a tool to capture, store, analyze, manage, and visualize land cover/use change and analysis.',\n",

Developing a contingency plan involves making decisions in advance about the management of human and financial resources, coordination and communications procedures, and being aware of a range of technical and logistical responses. Such planning is a management tool, involving all sectors, which can help ensure timely and effective provision of humanitarian aid to those most in need when a disaster occurs. Time spent in contingency planning equals time saved when a disaster occurs. Effective contingency planning should lead to timely and effective disaster-relief operations. The contingency planning process can basically be broken down into three simple questions: What is going to happen? What are we going to do about it? What can we do ahead of time to get prepared? This training helps planners think through these questions in a systematic way. Contingency planning is most often undertaken when there is a specific threat or hazard; exactly how that threat will actually impact is unknown. Developing scenarios is a good way of thinking through the possible impacts. On the basis of sensible scenarios it is possible to develop a plan that sets out the scale of the responseandthe resources needed.',\n",

The Africa’s dairy industry is however faced with a number of challenges, including low productivity per cow, fluctuating milk production, inconsistent milk quality, the high cost of production, inefficiencies along the value chain and a large informal sector dominance in milk sale. As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers are characterized by low milk output and low milk quality leading to low income from sale of milk. With the anticipated increase in demand of dairy products following population growth, urbanisation and improved purchasing power, there is need for dairy farmers to embrace interventions that may lead to increased milk productivity and enhanced milk quality. This 5-days course will equip participants with hands on skills on feed types, quality and quantity, feed storage and preservation, housing of a dairy cow, dairy cow management and record keeping among others.

As a result of these challenges, dairy farmers end up making losses or stagnant in their production which is contrary to their goal of making profit.

Little attention is given to characteristics often associated with survey data, including missing data, unequal probabilities of selection, stratified multistage sample designs, and measurement errors. Most standard statistical procedures in software packages commonly used for data analysis do not allow the analyst to take these properties of survey data into account unless specialized survey procedures are used. Failure to do so can have an important impact on the results of all types of analyses, ranging from simple descriptive statistics to estimates of parameters of multivariate models. This course provides an introduction to specialized software procedures that have been developed for the analysis of complex sample survey data including testing for between-group differences in means and proportions, regression analysis, logistic regression and multilevel modeling. We will also consider the consequences of non response and missing data on survey analysis and methods for dealing with missing data. Specialized procedures for survey data analysis from the Stata systems for data management and analysis will be used to develop course examples and exercises',\n",

       "  'Scientific research may not be completely objective if it is not gender sensitive. This is because gender norms affect who does the research, how research is prioritized, how the research is designed and conducted, and how data is interpreted and shared as well as the impact of the research at the community level and globally. Also, many countries have adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that besides having a gender equality goal every other goal has a gender dimension in it. To establish the implementation of these goals, development research is led by science. Therefore, if science is gender biased then the research will not produce the right results. For research to ensure equal benefits between men and women, it is imperative to integrate gender dimensions into your research right from the proposal planning stage and throughout the entire cycle of research. This means being gender sensitive beginning from proposal development, implementation all the way to realizing the impact of research. Similarly, gender norms and gender inequality within the cultural context where scaling is taking place influence uptake of technologies. Therefore, failing to take into account gender differences in needs, preferences, roles and responsibilities, decision-making, access to and control of resources that includes (land, labor, inputs, credits and revenue), and power imbalances can limit the adoption of technologies and also lead to research providing recommendations that are not gender inclusive. Consequently, the research can result in the development of policies, legal frameworks and laws that are gender biased thereby perpetuate gender inequality. Integrating gender into scientific research will improve the quality and relevance of research, and lead to new ideas and ways of thinking about issues, and new interpretations of data. This will contribute to innovation, and will improve the outcomes of the research for both women and men, and for entire society at large.',\n",

Using open standards set forth by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing. GeoServer allows you to display your spatial information to the world. Implementing theWeb Map Service (WMS) standard, GeoServer can create maps in a variety of output formats.OpenLayers, a free mapping library, is integrated into GeoServer, making map generation quick and easy. GeoServer is built on Geotools,an open source Java GIS toolkit. There is much more to GeoServer than nicely styled maps, though. GeoServer also conforms to the Web Feature Service(WFS) standard, which permits the actual sharing and editing of the data that is used to generate the maps. Others can incorporate your data into their websites and applications, freeing your data and permitting greater transparency. GeoServer is free software. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional GIS products. In addition, not only is it available free of charge, it is also open source. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to traditional software solutions. Leveraging GeoServer in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costly support contracts down the road. GeoServer can display data on any of the popular mapping applications such asGoogle Maps, Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and Microsoft Virtual Earth. In addition, GeoServer can connect with traditional GIS architectures such asESRI ArcGIS. This will help participants on how to administrate and publish GIS data with GeoServer, build their custom maps using your own data without the need for costly commercial software. The participants will learn how to load, publish, and share geospatial data with GeoServer. Including navigating the GeoServer user interface, OGC web services, styling data with SLD, connect to backend data such as PostGIS and tile caching with GeoWebCache.',\n",

Public health focuses on the health of populations rather than of individuals and focuses more on prevention of health problems. These efforts fall naturally within the domain of problems requiring use of spatial analysis as part of the solution, and GIS and other spatial analysis tools are therefore recognized as providing potentially transformational capabilities for Epidemiology and public health efforts. Statistics are a mainstay in the toolkit of public health professionals. Human memory being what it is, however, even Public health professionals with reasonable statistical training, over the years, often forget the basics. If professionals are going to make sensible use of consultants, communicate effectively with funders, and understand others’ reports, then they often need at least a conceptual understanding of relatively complex, recently developed statistical techniques. This course are: to link common public health questions with appropriate statistical procedures; to offer a strong conceptual grounding in several important statistical procedures; and to describe how to interpret the results from the statistics in ways that are principled and will be persuasive to intended audiences using simple software tools. Participants will acquire hands-on skills in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool to capture, store, analyze, manage, and visualize disease cases data that is geographically linked. The participants will also acquire statistical data analysis skills.',\n",

It’s a known fact that information is processed from facts and figures; we also agree that if data is not well managed it can be overwhelming. Giving a spatial dimension to data and performing spatial analysis in a GIS environment speeds interpretation visualization which eventually speeds up implementation of programs. To make timely decisions requires not only innovative ways to access accurate and real time information, but also tools to help present the information in ways that are useful .Integrating GIS and Remote Sensing as a decision making tool has seen many organizations gain competitive advantage and remain relevant globally. Everything that happens in this world has a spatial dimension and this has made GIS applicable across all fields e.g. in health, agriculture, forestry, mining, crime, business, transport and communications, utility management, climate change, planning etc. A geographic information system (GIS) will allow you to bring all types of data inform of layers, overlay them to perform analysis and eventually publish a map from that. This training workshop is aimed at helping our client understand how well they can apply GIS and RS in their day to day running of their organization. The course will be offered in a mixture of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on exercises in Quantum GIS (QGIS).',\n",

       "  'Pastoral livestock production is practiced in an estimated area of 43% percent of Africa land mass in different regions of Africa by an estimate of 268 million pastoralists. Pastoralism plays an important role in the national and regional economies of Africa in terms of export of animals to both domestic and international markets. Furthermore, pastoralism contributes a percentage of 10 to 44 of the gross domestic product (GDP) of African countries. Despite the significant impact of pastoralism to livelihoods, economy of Africa’s drylands, GDP and exports sector, pastoralists are faced with various challenges including climate change and climate variability, increasing risk of animal and zoonotic diseases, insecure land rights and natural resource management, violence, displacement and militarisation of pastoral livelihood systems and neglect and exclusion of pastoralist communities among other challenges. One of the key intervention to ensure sustainable livelihoods of pastoralist is focus on building resilience to mitigate effects of climate change. Resilience is being understood in terms of building different types of capacity within communities and social-ecological systems. Building resilience of vulnerable communities to the vagaries of climate change calls for more transformative approaches that can organically evolve to suit the dynamic and unique needs of different farming systems. This 5- days course aim to equip participants with knowledge of empowering pastoralist in building resilience to mitigate effects of climate change. ',\n",

Specifically, Goal 1 and 2 on ending poverty in all forms everywhere and ending hunger respectively are related in that, in most cases poverty is the main reason for hunger at the household level or at the national level. Many countries have put effort in the agriculture sector to improve production. While increased agricultural production is essential in improving food security status of household and the nation, it is not sufficient to reduce hunger and poverty. There is therefore a need for promoting the entire agricultural value chain through collaborative efforts among the state and the non-state actors such as donors, banks, civil society organizations, private sector, religious groups, and agricultural associations among other groups. These collaborations can be informed by studying the entire chain, identifying opportunities and constraints and assessing the need for Business Development Services (BDSs) that includes input, advisory services, market information/communication, business management, legal services, financial services, transport services, insurance, farm implements (tools and equipment) and value addition that can help smallholder farmers improve enterprise(s) performance. This 5 day course intends to equip participants with knowledge on use of strategies that involve provision of financial and non- financial products such as market information through ICT, advisory/technical support for capacity building, gathering and storage, value addition which contribute to the improved value chains among others all intended to enhance agribusiness role in food security.',\n",

The sector contributes up to 23% to the GDP in most of the African countries and hence remains critical to local and regional economies. It is the basis for food security and an important source of employment, particularly for women who provide much of labor. Despite the women contribution to the sector, their participation is limited by factors including inequitable access to agricultural inputs, including family labour, high-yield crops, pesticides, and fertilizer, legal and cultural status, exclusion from alternative employment options and inheritance laws. In the spirit of achieving the aspiration of vision 2030 of leaving no one behind and particularly women, there is need to understand through gender analysis the extent to which women are included in the agricultural sector. Gender analysis provides information to integrate a gender perspective into policies, programmes and projects. To add on, conducting a gender analysis allows for the development of interventions that address gender inequalities and meet the different needs of women and men. This 5 days course will equip participants with knowledge about specific set of frameworks and methods for participants to use in order to integrate gender components into their agricultural projects and programs. Participants will also gain gender analysis skills through effective and systematic analysis of contexts and also be able to plan development from a gender equality perspective.',\n",

       "  \"Agricultural sector is critical in fostering economic development in Africa and Sub Saharan Africa. More than 60 % of sub Saharan Africa’s population is smallholder farmers and up to 23 % of GDP in this region comes from agriculture. In Africa, about 40 % of the population which is equivalent to 80 million people live with disabilities. Despite the contribution of agriculture to nation’s gross domestic product, employment creation, food security among others, the majority of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lives in rural areas and they are prone to severe poverty and deprivation. The social exclusion of people living with disability has led to lack of empowerment efforts for people with disability through Agriculture based interventions since many of them experience social and economic exclusion due to their disability. In the spirit of adoption of vision 2030 agenda, which is in accordance with UN member states pledge to ensure “no one will be left behind” and to “endeavor to reach the furthest behind first”, there is need to enhance gender equality and social inclusion in agriculture a sector that supports a majority of rural population. What's more, gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) can promote equitable development.\",\n",

Such loss and waste does not only lead to reduced farmers’ incomes and increase consumers’ expenses but also present many negative economic and environmental challenges. While the number of food insecure population remains unacceptably high, massive quantities of food are lost due to spoilage and infestations before they can be consumed. Reducing food losses and waste is a proven way of ensuring food security. This training course is designed to shed light on causes of postharvest losses and strategies that can reduce such losses.',\n",

Countries that are usually affected by drought and floods among other climate change risks rely on emergency assistance which is in most cases not sufficient due to limited resources in those countries. Furthermore, predictions of future climate change by the countries meteorological departments are sometimes uncertain, and the future impacts are difficult to predict.

The workshop offers intensive training that will cover the fundamental concepts and tools for DRR. People-centered early warning systems empower communities to prepare for and confront the power of natural hazards and measurement of the systems in terms of lives saved and reduction in losses, which is directly related to the execution of an anticipated response by the people and institutions once a warning is issued. This training will also address traditional views on early warning systems, and what it takes to transform them into efficient, people-centred systems. The workshop also presents a practical guide for using a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate, visualize, and analyze geographically-referenced data extracted from key data sets to facilitate DRR.',\n",

Developing a contingency plan involves making decisions in advance about the management of human and financial resources, coordination and communications procedures, and being aware of a range of technical and logistical responses. Such planning is a management tool, involving all sectors, which can help ensure timely and effective provision of humanitarian aid to those most in need when a disaster occurs. Time spent in contingency planning equals time saved when a disaster occurs. Effective contingency planning should lead to timely and effective disaster-relief operations. The contingency planning process can basically be broken down into three simple questions: What is going to happen? What are we going to do about it? What can we do ahead of time to get prepared? This training helps planners think through these questions in a systematic way. Contingency planning is most often undertaken when there is a specific threat or hazard; exactly how that threat will actually impact is unknown. Developing scenarios is a good way of thinking through the possible impacts. On the basis of sensible scenarios it is possible to develop a plan that sets out the scale of the responseandthe resources needed.',\n",

The advancement in the concept of vegetation mapping has greatly increased research on land use land cover change thus providing an accurate evaluation of the spread and health of the world’s forest, grassland, and agricultural resources has become an important priority. Viewing the Earth from space is now crucial to the understanding of the influence of man’s activities on his natural resource base over time. In situations of rapid and often unrecorded land use change, observations of the earth from space provide objective information of human utilization of the landscape. Over the past years, data from Earth sensing satellites has become vital in mapping the Earth’s features and infrastructures, managing natural resources and studying environmental change. Participants will therefore acquire hands-on skills in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing as a tool to capture, store, analyze, manage, and visualize land cover/use change and analysis.',\n",

For farmers, data such as weather data, market price data, and agricultural inputs data can improve farmer productivity by addressing key constraints, providing knowledge and access to appropriate inputs, extension advice, weather warnings and market prices. Data on quantity of produce, seasonal variation in production and varieties of crops grown can inform other actors in other sectors such as manufacturing in planning on expected quantity of produce supply.
