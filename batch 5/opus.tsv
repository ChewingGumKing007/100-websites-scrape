https://www.opuskinetic.com/training/masterclass-on-understanding-drilling-contracts-2/	Understanding Drilling Contracts	2022-07-04	2022-07-07		This is a 4-day drilling contracts training. The ‘Upstream’ or Exploration and Production (E&P) segment of the International Oil and Gas Industry, is in all probability, the riskiest in terms of capital intensity, long payback periods; technological dependence and a host of legal/environmental compliance requirements. It is commonplace for entities seeking hydrocarbon reserves to offset this risk exposure through collective entities such as Joint Ventures. This drilling contracts training course has been specifically designed to provide the delegate with a holistic understanding not only of drilling contracts, but to understand them within the wider context of the larger governing framework of which they are a part in terms of hydrocarbon discovery and extraction. The course is an immersive experience and the focus is on open dialogue throughout and class exercises/problem solving and knowledge sharing.

The International Oil and Gas Industry is extremely dynamic – it is constantly evolving, driven by and dependent upon technology. Ever more remote and inhospitable environments such as the Arctic and Ultra-deep water drilling operations push the boundaries of capabilities on a daily basis as the search for a sustainable competitive advantage quickens. There are multiple stakeholders – each with a different agenda or perspective – the need to manage these interfaces is critical if the modern oil and gas organisation is to survive and flourish. The true capital of any organisation is its people and the knowledge and abilities that they possess. It is imperative to add to this value by ongoing development and learning – investment in this way will contribute directly to the creation and sustainability of a competitive advantage.

The planning, preparation and execution of a turnaround is a complex undertaking that demands an effective strategy, a high degree of control and great attention to detail. It also requires a profound understanding of the critical elements that go to make up a turnaround and the drivers and constraints that shape the event. This requires involvement of every level of the company from senior management who set the framework for the event to the craft personnel who perform the actual work. The shutting down and start-up phases of a turnaround are critical to the success or failure of the event and as such must be planned and prepared in as much detail as the mechanical phase. There comes a point in each area of the turnaround at which most tasks have been completed and the systems may be handed back to operations for start-up. This is a critical transition phase and if not properly controlled, time, money and effort can be wasted. Although it may seem to the casual observer that the start-up of the plant is simply the reverse of shutdown, there are some significant elements which differentiate the two events:		We are the premier provider of knowledge through people empowerment.

The effective Maintenance management within chemical plants is a critical feature of plant operation, both in establishing the conditions for safe ongoing operation of the plant after commissioning, and in supporting the commercial success of the business. Many companies focus on the cost of the maintenance organisation, rather than on the benefits that they can provide, and in doing so the real potential for maintenance organisations to make significant contributions to business success are often lost. Ultimately, and assuming that the commercial department is able to sell the product that is produced, the contribution of a maintenance organisation can most effectively be measured in terms of its ability to generate sustained improvements with time in the total (fixed and variable) cost per unit volume of production. There are a number of drivers which tend to increase the cost of production; certain types of equipment become unreliable with time, obsolescence is often an issue, environmental and safety standards are continuing to tighten, and so on.

This requires involvement of every level of the company from senior management who set the framework for the event to the craft personnel who perform the actual work. The shutting down and start-up phases of a turnaround are critical to the success or failure of the event and as such must be planned and prepared in as much detail as the mechanical phase. There comes a point in each area of the turnaround at which most tasks have been completed and the systems may be handed back to operations for start-up. This is a critical transition phase and if not properly controlled, time, money and effort can be wasted.
