In case of emergency closures, action is often taken based on panic. Very often these actions aggravate the situation, instead of resolving it. For planned closures of inlets, the time pressure (and panic) by virtue is less, but as these works are often bigger and more comprehensive, mistakes can have a huge impact and lead to risky situations.',\n",
