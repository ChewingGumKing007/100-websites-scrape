But what happens to these compounds at the end of their lifecycle? All sorts of chemicals from medications to plastics end up in our environment from our landfills to our water supply. In some cases, we know about their impact on plants and animals, but often we don’t know the full impacts of these substances in the environment or how long they will stick around.

Jonathan Hsy explores how adaptations of medieval literature reflect principles of disability justice, a present-day movement that addresses how social oppressions intersect (along the lines of disability, race, gender, and citizenship status). Hsy shows how diverse forms of medieval writing (including lyric poetry, saint’s lives, and chivalric romances) have long inspired the activist writings of BIPOC authors (from the early multiracial authors Sui Sin Far and Alice Dunbar-Nelson to modern-day novelists Maxine Hong Kingston and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha).
