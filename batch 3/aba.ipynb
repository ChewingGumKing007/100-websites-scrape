Discrete mathematics has applications to all fields of computer science, and to the physical and biological sciences. It is used extensively in telecommunications, information processing, and manufacturing, and many businesses and industries use techniques of discrete optimization to improve the efficiency of their operations.Discrete mathematics is a dynamic field in both theory and applications. Researchers in discrete mathematics have established important connections with mainstream areas of pure and applied mathematics, and as a consequence, research techniques and problems are drawn from a wide range of different fields, including algebra, topology, geometry, probability, analysis and logic.The purpose of this conference is to highlight the major theoretical advances in the field, the development of new tools for discrete mathematics, and the most significant of the new applications of discrete mathematics to problems arising in industry and business. The conference also seeks to bring together participants from the many different environments where discrete mathematics is developed and applied.',\n",

This conference of the activity group will provide a cross-disciplinary forum for catalyzing mathematical research relevant to the life sciences.

Remarkable agreement between theory and experiments can be claimed in many of these fields.The goals of the conference are to provide a forum for the development of mathematical methods and tools, to foster cross-fertilization among different fields of application, and most crucially to enable communication between the mathematicians who build the theory and the scientists who use it. The conference program will consist of presentations on subjects ranging from basic mathematical research to concrete applications.',\n",

The scope includes theoretical analysis, as well as experimental validation, and the mathematical problems related to their development or limitations. The scope also includes aspects of combinatorics and discrete mathematics related to discrete algorithms. Papers that raise important algorithmic problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged.

       "  'This is the meeting of the SIAM Activity Group on Computational Science and Engineering. Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) complement theory and experiment as a critical component of scientific discovery. CSE is indispensable for leading edge investigation and engineering design in a vast number of industrial sectors, including for example, aerospace, automotive, biological, chemical, and semiconductor technologies that all rely increasingly on advanced modeling and simulation. CSE also contributes to policy and decisions relating to human health, resources, transportation, and defense. Finally, in many new areas such as medicine, the life sciences, management and marketing (e.g., data and stream mining), and finance, techniques and algorithms from CSE are of growing importance. CSE is naturally interdisciplinary. Its goals concern understanding and analyzing complex systems, predicting their behavior, and optimizing processes and designs. CSE thus grows out of physical applications, while depending on computer architecture and software, and having at its core powerful algorithms. At the frontiers of CSE remain many open problems and challenges, including the verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of computational models; the analysis and assimilation of large and complex data sets, including techniques for visualization and animation; and the design of flexible CSE software. The SIAM CSE conference seeks to enable in-depth technical discussions on a wide variety of major computational efforts on large-scale problems in science and engineering, foster the interdisciplinary culture required to meet these large-scale challenges, and promote the training of the next generation of computational scientists.
