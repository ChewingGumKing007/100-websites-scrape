This year, we will be focusing on sustainable and bio-based materials. With the world becoming increasingly aware of ecological and environmental struggles from pollutants such as microplastics, the materials community has a very real role to play in overcoming the challenges presented by phasing out these materials and replacing them with more environmentally compatible materials. Sustainable materials also have a huge role to play in tacking climate change, with an estimated annual total of 880 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents produced from European manufacturing industries alone – sustainable materials technologies are one of many avenues in which science may present solutions to the threat of climate change.

Popular, as it is an ingredient in countless food and personal care products, due to its versatility and low cost. It is also used increasingly as a source of biofuel. Unpopular, as the huge growth in the use of palm oil combined with the need for hot and wet growing conditions has resulted in oil palm plantations displacing millions of hectares of tropical rainforest, with an environmental cost in terms of loss of habitats and biodiversity, and release of CO2. Various initiatives have been devised to mitigate this including from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the recent pledges to reduce deforestation at COP26, and the substitution of palm oil by other oils. However, how effective are these initiatives, to what extent is substitution feasible, and how sustainable are the alternatives compared to palm oil?
