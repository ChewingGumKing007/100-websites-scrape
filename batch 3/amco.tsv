https://www.americanconference.com/russia-think-tank	Russia Sanctions Think Tank	2022-06-16	2022-06-16		The U.S. has imposed sweeping economic sanctions restrictions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine including sanctioning the top Russian banks, Russian oligarchs and their family members, numerous Russian entities and prohibiting new debt and equity of major Russian state-owned enterprises and privately owned financial institutions. The UK and EU have also issued their own set of sanctions restrictions. Businesses are now confronting unprecedented and uncertain business, legal, compliance, ethical and reputational risks – without an actionable blueprint for the path forward. Many financial institutions and companies have decided to suspend or withdraw from Russia, but many questions remain on how to move forward. ACI has created this new, interactive one-day Think Tank to delve into the very high stakes issues coming across your desk. Learn how your peers have been resolving expected (and unexpected) dilemmas and gain invaluable strategic insights on critically important questions, including: High Stake Business Decisions and Dilemmas: The Latest Takeaways from Revisiting Cross-Border Sanctions, Cyber, Operations and Reputational Risk Management Russia Counter Sanctions: Navigating Potential Threats and Asset Seizures for Companies Who Withdraw or Temporarily Suspend Operations Managing Rapid SDN Changes and The Latest Russian Ownership Transfers: Ensuring Robust Sanctions Screening and KYC Processes Evaluating the Future of Your Business in Russia: Short, Medium, and Long-Term Implications of Continuing Operations vs. a Partial or Complete Withdrawal Industry Specific Breakouts: Separate sessions for financial institutions, insurance, technology OFAC KEYNOTE Blake Santos Senior Compliance OfficerOffice of Foreign Assets ControlU.S. Department of the Treasury Learn More		Our conferences connect the power of people with the power of information, a powerful combination for business growth and success.

https://www.americanconference.com/false-claims-qui-tam-enforcement	9th Annual Advanced Forum onFalse Claims and Qui Tam Enforcement	2022-06-22	2022-06-23		The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) released its annual statistics for the False Claims Act (FCA) and fraud cases for fiscal year 2021. The DOJ reported that it recovered $5.6 billion in final judgments and settlements during this time period — the second largest annual total in FCA history, and the largest since 2014. With 598 qui tam lawsuits filed in 2021, and 203 filed by DOJ, the recovery statistics for fiscal year 2021 show a sustained and aggressive use of the FCA by the government and qui tam relators alike. The DOJ also announced that the Civil Division will “energetically use every enforcement tool available to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting the COVID-19 crisis.” In addition, DOJ appointed a Chief Prosecutor to lead pandemic recovery fraud efforts. Finally, DOJ revealed the creation of a Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative that will utilize the FCA to pursue cybersecurity related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients. By all accounts, the trend for government initiated FCA actions is continuing to climb, leaving the industry wondering: What will total recoveries amount to at the end of Fiscal ’22? What can we expect for Fiscal ‘22? Where will government enforcement priorities lie? Which industries are at greatest risk? What can you do now to prepare for the next wave of FCA enforcement and protect your client’s interests? ACI’s 9th Advanced Forum on False Claims and Qui Tam Enforcement, taking place IN-PERSON in New York City, will address the underlying controversies and challenges posed by these questions. Join us for in-depth discussions and analyses of the latest guidance, initiatives, and enforcement statistics, featuring a faculty of government speakers and leading defense, in-house, and relators’ counsel.

https://www.americanconference.com/biosimilars	13th Summit onBiosimilars & Innovator Biologics	2022-06-28	2022-06-29		Join the “who’s who” of the biosimilars and innovator biologics industries in Boston this June. Biosimilars and innovator biologics are among the most groundbreaking therapies that treat many life-threatening conditions. However, even with a calendar year that included 4 FDA approvals, 3 launches in the United Sates, 2 approvals for interchangeable biosimilars, and several regulatory and legal developments, the traditional barriers continue to be complicated, interconnected, and best addressed by stakeholder collaboration. We’ve reached an inflection point in the United States. With another major wave of loss of exclusivities of original biological medicines expected in the next five to ten years, it is imperative that industry is well prepared today. Now, more than ever, strategies to overcome these barriers are essential to improve the understanding of biosimilar products in the United States. The need for a solid guiding framework becomes more critical than ever before. In this context, we cordially invite you to explore the contours of the rapidly changing landscape for biosimilars and innovator biologics. This June, join the “who’s who” of the biosimilars and innovator biologics industries as they gather in Boston for ACI’s 13th Annual Summit on Biosimilars & Innovator Biologics.
