She will explain the “engineering of peace” conducted after five periods of bloody imperial overreach in Europe. How did political leaders, diplomats and philosophers attempt to channel chaotic events according to their will? What was the role of popular aspirations? Where did promoters of peace succeed? Where did they fail?After 75 years of peace in Europe, except in the Western Balkans in the 1990s, war has started again with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Can the gains of peace be restored? Political Europe is at the crossroads, and this history might help us to understand where it will go next.Stella Ghervas is Professor of Russian History at Newcastle University (UK) and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. She is the author or editor of six books in French and in English. Her book Réinventer la tradition: Alexandre Stourdza et l’Europe de la Sainte-Alliance (Paris, 2008), won the Guizot Prize from the Académie française.
