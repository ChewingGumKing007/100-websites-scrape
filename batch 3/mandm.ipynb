       "  'High growth markets which contribute to 20% of your revenues today will contribut 80% in the next 5 years. Identify these new revenue sources at MarketsandMarkets’ Crystal Ball Event! The Global semiconductor market was valued at US$ 554 billion in 2021, an increase of 26% percent from 2020. Analog segment was the major growth rate contributor, followed by Memory, and Logic. It is expected that the semiconductor market in 2020 will cross US$600 billion, primarily driven by the increasing semiconductor content across the end-user industries including automotive, consumer electronics, data centers, Industrial, Healthcare, Energy and Power etc. The semiconductor manufacturing supply chain is complex with intellectual property originating in a few regions. Semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and fab facilities are mostly concentrated Chin, East Asia, China, Taiwan, and US. Supplier dependency, environmental risks, political/governance change, economic instability, and geopolitical factors such as US current sanctions on China, and Ukraine and Russia War are some of the factors leading to supply chain issues in semiconductor industry. Automotive industry is facing the biggest supply chain challenge as automobile manufacturers are facing issues including chip shortages, material availability, extended lead times etc. The average lead time, the gap between when a semiconductor is ordered and when it’s delivered has increased considerably to 28 weeks. The shortage in semiconductor due to supply chain issues has hampered the recovery post pandemic for automobile manufacturers and the Automotive OEMs have lost approximately USD 180 billion in sales in 2021. The global semiconductor industry is committed to increase the overall semiconductor production capacity by either expanding their current fabrication facilities or investing in new ones. Supply chain members across the globe including semiconductor component manufacturers and government organizations are taking initiatives towards the development of semiconductor industry and ease supply chain issues. For instance, TSMC is planning to spend approximately US$ 44 billion to increase its production capacity by up to 47% this year. In 2021, the EU introduced the “2030 Digital Compass Initiative,” which explicitly set a goal of increasing the EU’s share of global chip manufacturing from 10% in 2020 to 20% by 2030. Rising demand for high-performance and power efficient semiconductor ICs is leading to the investment in low process technology nodes (under 10 nm, mainly at 3 nm, 5 nm and 7 nm). Demand drivers include AI/ML, IoT, 5G, Blockchain, Robotics, intelligent edge, cloud computing, hardware accelerators etc. Rise in digitalization, implementation of automation technologies, compute power at the edge of the network, demand for high reliability and low latency networks is creating the need to collaborate with supply chain partners not only identify supply chain issues but also to identify attractive, high growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry. Participants such as CIOs, CTOs, CMOs, semiconductor supply chain members can benefit from this unprecedented growth over the next five years.',\n",

       "  'Single-cell analysis is crucial for discovering population heterogeneity, identifying minority sub-populations of interest, and discovering unique properties of individual cells. Microfluidic systems operate on a scale comparable to cell width and are capable of manipulating single cells. Single-cell sequencing is a new and powerful technique for studying the evolution and variety of most malignancies, as well as the involvement of circulating tumour cells in cancer progression. These techniques have begun to answer critical problems in cancer biology that have been difficult to answer using bulk tumour measurements. The technology and applications of single-cell analysis have advanced dramatically in the last five years. Recent breakthroughs in single cell technology have offered new possibilities for identifying intra-tumor cell heterogeneity, identifying unusual cell types, and determining the degree of mutation, all of which can help guide diagnoses and therapy options. Our 4th Annual MarketsandMarkets Single-Cell Analysis Conference scheduled to be held on 6th - 7th October 2022 goal is to bring together researchers and scientists from top universities and pharmaceutical companies from all over the world to discuss significant innovations and difficulties in single-cell analysis, as well as provide a platform for academic peers to share their experiences and reveal their research articles and reports.',\n",

The Global semiconductor market was valued at US$ 554 billion in 2021, an increase of 26% percent from 2020. Analog segment was the major growth rate contributor, followed by Memory, and Logic. It is expected that the semiconductor market in 2020 will cross US$600 billion, primarily driven by the increasing semiconductor content across the end-user industries including automotive, consumer electronics, data centers, Industrial, Healthcare, Energy and Power etc. The semiconductor manufacturing supply chain is complex with intellectual property originating in a few regions. Semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and fab facilities are mostly concentrated Chin, East Asia, China, Taiwan, and US. Supplier dependency, environmental risks, political/governance change, economic instability, and geopolitical factors such as US current sanctions on China, and Ukraine and Russia War are some of the factors leading to supply chain issues in semiconductor industry. Automotive industry is facing the biggest supply chain challenge as automobile manufacturers are facing issues including chip shortages, material availability, extended lead times etc. The average lead time, the gap between when a semiconductor is ordered and when it’s delivered has increased considerably to 28 weeks. The shortage in semiconductor due to supply chain issues has hampered the recovery post pandemic for automobile manufacturers and the Automotive OEMs have lost approximately USD 180 billion in sales in 2021. The global semiconductor industry is committed to increase the overall semiconductor production capacity by either expanding their current fabrication facilities or investing in new ones. Supply chain members across the globe including semiconductor component manufacturers and government organizations are taking initiatives towards the development of semiconductor industry and ease supply chain issues. For instance, TSMC is planning to spend approximately US$ 44 billion to increase its production capacity by up to 47% this year. In 2021, the EU introduced the “2030 Digital Compass Initiative,” which explicitly set a goal of increasing the EU’s share of global chip manufacturing from 10% in 2020 to 20% by 2030. Rising demand for high-performance and power efficient semiconductor ICs is leading to the investment in low process technology nodes (under 10 nm, mainly at 3 nm, 5 nm and 7 nm). Demand drivers include AI/ML, IoT, 5G, Blockchain, Robotics, intelligent edge, cloud computing, hardware accelerators etc. Rise in digitalization, implementation of automation technologies, compute power at the edge of the network, demand for high reliability and low latency networks is creating the need to collaborate with supply chain partners not only identify supply chain issues but also to identify attractive, high growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry. Participants such as CIOs, CTOs, CMOs, semiconductor supply chain members can benefit from this unprecedented growth over the next five years.',\n",

Now, with COVID therapeutic manufacturing taking space, there also is a big desire to accelerate other clinical pipeline because of the ample opportunity for new medicine. While some companies were able to cope with their contingencies plan in place, the other followed risk mitigation. It is now essential for the pharma supply chain and logistics to follow the redundancy routes. The 3rd Annual MarketsandMarkets World Pharma Supply Chain and Cold Chain Logistics Conference will hold discussions on supply chain for virtual clinical trials, prediction models in pharmaceutical supply chain, smart packaging, managing international cold chain logistics, supply chain and logistics world after COVID and increasing the use of IOT & automated processes. This conference will also address how on-shoring is picking up against the general trend of off shoring. The event will witness an overwhelming participation of leading supply chain and logistics decision makers.',\n",

       " 'High growth markets which contribute to 20% of your revenues today will contribut 80% in the next 5 years. Identify these new revenue sources at MarketsandMarkets’ Crystal Ball Event! The Global semiconductor market was valued at US$ 554 billion in 2021, an increase of 26% percent from 2020. Analog segment was the major growth rate contributor, followed by Memory, and Logic. It is expected that the semiconductor market in 2020 will cross US$600 billion, primarily driven by the increasing semiconductor content across the end-user industries including automotive, consumer electronics, data centers, Industrial, Healthcare, Energy and Power etc. The semiconductor manufacturing supply chain is complex with intellectual property originating in a few regions. Semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and fab facilities are mostly concentrated Chin, East Asia, China, Taiwan, and US. Supplier dependency, environmental risks, political/governance change, economic instability, and geopolitical factors such as US current sanctions on China, and Ukraine and Russia War are some of the factors leading to supply chain issues in semiconductor industry. Automotive industry is facing the biggest supply chain challenge as automobile manufacturers are facing issues including chip shortages, material availability, extended lead times etc. The average lead time, the gap between when a semiconductor is ordered and when it’s delivered has increased considerably to 28 weeks. The shortage in semiconductor due to supply chain issues has hampered the recovery post pandemic for automobile manufacturers and the Automotive OEMs have lost approximately USD 180 billion in sales in 2021. The global semiconductor industry is committed to increase the overall semiconductor production capacity by either expanding their current fabrication facilities or investing in new ones. Supply chain members across the globe including semiconductor component manufacturers and government organizations are taking initiatives towards the development of semiconductor industry and ease supply chain issues. For instance, TSMC is planning to spend approximately US$ 44 billion to increase its production capacity by up to 47% this year. In 2021, the EU introduced the “2030 Digital Compass Initiative,” which explicitly set a goal of increasing the EU’s share of global chip manufacturing from 10% in 2020 to 20% by 2030. Rising demand for high-performance and power efficient semiconductor ICs is leading to the investment in low process technology nodes (under 10 nm, mainly at 3 nm, 5 nm and 7 nm). Demand drivers include AI/ML, IoT, 5G, Blockchain, Robotics, intelligent edge, cloud computing, hardware accelerators etc. Rise in digitalization, implementation of automation technologies, compute power at the edge of the network, demand for high reliability and low latency networks is creating the need to collaborate with supply chain partners not only identify supply chain issues but also to identify attractive, high growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry. Participants such as CIOs, CTOs, CMOs, semiconductor supply chain members can benefit from this unprecedented growth over the next five years.',\n",
