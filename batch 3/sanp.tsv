But not exclusively. Like many pre-pandemic marquee events, RSAC has gone through its own phases of ‘COVID-coping.’ After going fully virtual in 2021, a planned return to an in-person event in February got derailed by the midwinter surge. After a four-month postponement – and barring anything further unforeseen – RSA 2022 will be hybrid, with both a virtual and an in-person component.

While many corporations have begun to voluntarily disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and set net-zero targets over the coming decades, other companies are just beginning their ESG journey. Following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recently proposed, and long-anticipated, climate disclosure requirements, the pressure is heating up for companies to accelerate their plans to capture, measure, and disclose emissions data.

Inflation and interest rates have risen, and many other global factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, pandemic, supply chain issues, and labor shortages, remain tenuous.
