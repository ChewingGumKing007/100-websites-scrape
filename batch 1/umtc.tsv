We are excited to bring this event back since its last appearance in Portland, OR in 2005. This conference will address the traditional uses of tobacco and commercial tobacco impact in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities across the United States. A disparate proportion of AI/AN communities use commercial tobacco compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. High prevalences of commercial tobacco use among AI/AN Tribes are directly reflected in the disproportionate rates of chronic diseases in AI/AN populations. There is an urgent need to bring Tribes together at a national level to educate one another on successes and setbacks in commercial tobacco prevention and control among AI/ANs. The conference will emphasize AI/AN persons returning to a healthy relationship with tobacco, the importance of creating health equity, and provide an opportunity for networking and collaboration. We expect an audience composed of AI/AN community leaders, community members, healthcare providers serving these communities, researchers in tobacco and healthcare, students interested in public health and tobacco prevention/cessation. You belong here. All generations welcome.

To help you plan and prepare for the mindful movement portion of each weekly session, the following is a list of considerations and/or supplies you will want to have on hand: Qigong: Space to stand and move your arms freely. Lying down yoga: A blanket, yoga mat, or a large towel, and space to lay down and stretch out on the floor. Chair yoga: A chair, preferably without wheels. Standing yoga: Space to securely stand and move your arms freely. If possible, you may wish to stand on a yoga mat or on an uncarpeted floor to enhance a sense of stability when practicing standing yoga.

To turn this around, we need to transform our wealth-based, extractive civilization into a sustainable and equitable ecological civilization. This transition requires that we build universal climate literacy. It makes our classrooms ground zero for this effort. In this intensive four-day summer school, literacy educators Marek Oziewicz and Nick Kleese will guide you to engage with pedagogical practices of envisioning, embodying, and enacting climate literacy education in your classroom. You will learn why traditional climate change education (CCE), focused on scientific and environmental facts, is inadequate to address the social, racial, and political dimensions of climate change. You will explore climate literacy as a broader competence that includes climate science but focuses primarily on developing attitudes and values aligned with how we should live to respect our planetary home. You will learn why stories for young people—in books, films, games, and other narrative media—are the best technology for the social transformation that ensures everyone’s future: a technology that makes climate literacy accessible to every student everywhere. This summer school will be offered fully on zoom, between 8 am and 4 pm (with a lunch break 12-1 pm). It will consist of 4 full-day sessions on 6/14 (T), 6/16 (Th), 6/20 (M), 6/22 (W).
